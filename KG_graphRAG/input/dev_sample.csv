Staff member (visiting Westhill Office from another region) was in a meeting within Building 3, training room 4 when she accessed the electrical socket located within a floor port beneath her seat.  On plugging in her laptop, the floor port cover was replaced but not securely (leaving the cover proud of the housing).    As she adjusted her chair, the leg contacted the exposed lip of the insecure cover, dislodging it from the housing and exposing the recess.   Subsequently the leg of her chair fell through the opening causing the chair to become unstable and her to fall to the side.  No injuries were sustained in this event.  The event was immediately communicated to the HSE and facilities department and the cover was reinstated securely.    The recent communication from Intelex 60676 (LTI) had been communicated 'in detail' prior to the meeting as a Take 5 and a key focus for meeting room safety.  This raises a more significant issue with regards to the suitability of floor ports and users ability to re0instate them properly.

24489,"On 10/19/2024 TFMC Technicians arrived on location at 07:00to rig in equipment on the EQT Gregor Pad. FSTs completed JSA and performed pre job talk discussing the tasks for the day. Prior to lifting the eActuator Valve, the lead discussed the proper way to lift and strap it and assigned roles of the team that would be responsible for the task. One FST was designated as the lift operator, one FST was designated as spotter and signaler and a third FST designated in control of the tag line. The team began the rig up, lifted and secured the lower zipper valve as normal utilizing a JCB 12k telehandler. Moving next to the eActuator Valve, FSTs rigged and lifted as discussed with a 12ft blue strap utilizing a double basket (Front Bonnet To Rear Bonnet). This is rigged this way due to the extra weight from the adapter and motor on the front. Lifting with a four-point rig did not make up for shift in center of gravity for the load. Once rigging was in place the valve was then lifted with telehandler and positioned over the lower zipper to stab on. While lowering the eActuator Valve the bottom studs came into contact with the flange from the lower zipper causing a shift in weight. This made the valve hitch forward and become unbalanced and creating enough slack that the rear bonnet basket hitch came off causing the eActuator valve to fall forward to the ground (Approx. 6’3”/ 7500 lbs.).Once valve fell the lead tech stopped work to gather the information on what had happened and reported to management.

1280,"Environmental conditions: The Deep Blue was in the Mero 1 field. Vessel heading 085°, Wind direction 106° East by South, Wave direction 115°T, max wave 3M, Hsig 2M.  Events leading up to the incident: Day shift rigging team had installed the cross haul rigging for the Prod 2 pipeline flex joint onto the JFL head clamp. After it was connected the head clamp was raised to it’s highest position so it could be secured in the tower.  There was no hold back rigging fitted therefore when the rigging was approximately half way up the tower the rigging was swinging due to ships movement. The rigging hit and did minor damage to a Stauff pipe clamp that was securing a hydraulic line and also slight damage to a Devol wear pad that is used for the transfer block wires at low tower angles less than 65 degrees    A equipe de rigging do turno diurno instalou o rigging de cross haul para a Flexible Joint de Prod 2 no head clamp da JFL (J-Lay Firing Line) da torre.

N?o haviam lingadas de reten??o instaladas, portanto, quando o rigging estava aproximadamente na metade do caminho até a posi??o final, o rigging estava balan?ando devido ao movimento da embarcacao.

Environmental Conditions: The vessel was in Damen ship yard dry dock at the time of the event.  Task / Actions Leading up to the Incident: During the dry dock a number of valves are to be replaced across the vessel. The yard has delegated the task to a sub-contractor to come onboard and conduct this work scope. The work party had moved to the forward engine room to remove the next valve. All but one of the bolts had been removed and the last presented a problem as the nut started to round and the thread was stripping on the bolt. When attempting to remove the remaining bolt, one of the work party was holding and operating a drill with a socket extension from above and the IP was holding a spanner on the underside.  Incident / Initial Findings:. As the work party tried to remove the bolt, the nut slipped in the spanner and then bit again resulting in it turning pinching the IPs hand on the pipe below the flange. This resulted in a finger injury and bruising to the ring finger of his right hand.  Current Situation/ Initial Actions taken:. The IP moved to the engine locker room where he was met by a project engineer, they in turn took the individual to the medic for assessment. The medic assessed the wound and a cold compress was given.

23537,"Hall F  To improve poor cp on part of the bolts on a choke, one grinds off some of the coating on the bolts to make better contact. In this case, a cordless wrench with an attached Unbraco pipe was used to hold the bolt. At the same time, one holds a piece of sandpaper with the other hand against the bolt and drives the nut driver at a slow speed, to remove some of the coating on the bolt's threads. What then happened was that nut spokes were most likely driven a little too fast and disposable gloves were used to hold sandpaper against the bolt. It was possibly squeezed a little too hard against the bolt with the hand holding the sandpaper. The right hand/thumb, which was wearing disposable gloves, grabbed the bolt and was pulled with something in the rotation when the nut cover was driven. The nail on the right thumb was torn up a little and a little blood was observed, indicating that the nail has loosened somewhat from the thumb itself. This was rinsed/cleaned with distilled water and a bandage was applied. The person felt a little dizzy. Was given water and told to sit with the legs slightly higher than the body and relax. Suggested measures: Do not use disposable gloves for such a job. Drive as slowly as possible with a battery nut driver. Do this manually. Brush by hand. Use e.g. Dremel etc. with a suitable polishing tool. Do not use disposable gloves when operating a nut driver, drill/screwdriver and similar rotating tools. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ For ? f? utbedret d?rlig cp p? en del av boltene p? en choke, s? sliper en av litt av belegget p? boltene for ? f? bedre kontakt. Det ble i dette tilfellet brukt en muttertrekker p? batteri med p?montert Unbraco-pipe for ? holder bolten. Samtidig som en holder et pussepapir med den andre h?nden i mot bolten og kj?rer muttertrekker med sakte fart, for ? fjerne litt av belegget p? boltens gjenger. Det som da skjedde var at mutterekker ble kj?rt mest sannsynlig litt for fort og det ble brukt engangshansker for ? holde pussepapir i mot bolten. Det ble muligens klemt litt for hardt mot bolten med h?nden som holder pussepapir. H?yre h?nd/tommel som hadde engangshansker p? tok da tak i bolt og ble dratt med noe i rotasjonen n?r muttertekker ble kj?rt. Negl p? h?yre tommel ble revet litt opp og det ble observert litt blod som tilsier at negl har l?snet noe fra selve tommel. Dette ble skylt/renset med destillert vann og og bandasje ble tatt p?. Personen ble litt svimmel. Fikk vann og beskjed om ? sette seg med beina litt h?yere en kroppen og slappe av. Forslag til tiltak : Ikke bruke engangshansker p? en slik jobb. Kj?re sakta fart som mulig med batterimuttertrekker. Gj?re dette manuelt. Pusse for h?nd. Bruke f.eks Dremel o.l. med egnet pusseverkt?y.

17242,"On October 4, 2023 at approximately 09:45, TFMC personnel were prepping the WBRT assembly (P150372) for the upcoming run on the aux rotary. The rig was making up two pups below the tool. While making up the second pup the TSP noticed the painted indicator lines on the main body of the tool no longer aligned with the rest of the tool. The TSP notified the driller and went to get tools to re-align the running tool as well as get the engineer. Upon returning to the rig floor, the rig had attempted to lift the assembly to come off the slips. When they lifted the assembly the upper mandrel lifted out of the body leaving the body sitting on the lower mandrel which was still made up to pups and sitting in the slips. At this point all personnel were cleared from the red zone on the rig floor. Then they attempted to stab back into the body with the upper mandrel in an effort to thread the pieces back together. When the upper mandrel made contact with the body the body (~421 lbs) fell off the assembly and dropped approximately 20-25 feet to the rig floor. This case is a type of Accident.

17520,"Damage Incident – Damage to TLS handrail module stowed on the main deck  Task leading up to the incident:  The Skandi Africa is conducting a maintenance period alongside Takoradi Port, Ghana. As part of the work scope there is a Mobile Elevated Platform (MEWP) being utilised on the main deck to allow the crew access to conduct fabric maintenance on the 150te crane. The MEWP has been hired in from a sub-contractor with an operator for both shifts. Inside the barriered area where the MEWP had started to operate there were 2 x TLS handrail modules that had been stowed out of the way of TLS operations. From midnight the MEWP was in use with 2 x ABs in the basket and the sub-contractor MEWP operator at deck level manoeuvring the equipment around the 150te crane boom.  Description of the incident: At 04:00 the ABs on the MEWP platform requested to come back down to deck. As the MEWP operator lowered the boom arm the first knuckle of the arm made contact with the top handrail of a TLS handrail module that was positioned inside the operating area.  The impact from the heavy steel knuckle / boom arm caused the handrail to bend downwards (See attached photoboard). Both ABs have stated that there was no shift  / movement in the basket during the contact. At this point it is estimated that the basket was approximately just below 2m. from the deck.  On realisation of the impact the MEWP operator raised the boom arm, swung out aft of the handrail modules and lowered the crew to deck. The deck crew reported the contact to the Pipelay team. The OMT and HSE Advisor were informed of the damage at the daily meeting at 08:00.  Initial actions taken: ?	Task suspended by HSE A.  ?	Inspection conducted of the handrail module and MEWP.  ?	Both handrail modules removed out of the operating area.  ?	Review of PTW and TRA for the task – additional information added to include that the site be free from all obstacles prior to work commencement.  ?	Barriers reviewed and re-routed.  ?

17271,"On October 4, 2023 at approximately 09:45, TFMC personnel were prepping the WBRT assembly (P150372) for the upcoming run on the aux rotary. The rig was making up two pups below the tool. While making up the second pup the TSP noticed the painted indicator lines on the main body of the tool no longer aligned with the rest of the tool. The TSP notified the driller and went to get tools to re-align the running tool as well as get the engineer. Upon returning to the rig floor, the rig had attempted to lift the assembly to come off the slips. When they lifted the assembly the upper mandrel lifted out of the body leaving the body sitting on the lower mandrel which was still made up to pups and sitting in the slips. At this point all personnel were cleared from the red zone on the rig floor. Then they attempted to stab back into the body with the upper mandrel in an effort to thread the pieces back together.

15831,"Environmental - Minimal - BP Clair & Clair Ridge - 25.July.23 - Wachs cutter guide bar missing on return to the vessel  Environmental conditions: Wind: 4.6m/s, weather: 11C, 1005 mbar, cloudy  Task leading up to the Incident: The event occurred on Dive number 12: Diver Work scope (taken from Dive plan 012) Removal of Lower Chandelier Section ? Retrieve Wachs saw for the 8” nozzle cut (N6) ? Nozzle N6 to be cut in two locations – secure before second cut (wt: 6.4mm, weight 33.3kg/m) ? Recover Wachs saw and cut section in the tooling basket ? Deploy 04-16” DWS on messenger ? Retrieve 04-16” DWS from messenger line (40kg in water) and manoeuvre into position for the N8 cut ? Secure DWS as required   On recovery to the deck of the Deep Discoverer it was noted that the stainless steel guide bar on the Wachs cutter was missing, the bar was 62 CM long and 25 MM thick with an approximate weight of 2.5 KG out of water (the weight in salt water would be 2.18 KG).  It is not known at what point the guide bar dropped, however, the known facts are that the guide bar dropped from below the divers working position, and the transfer path was well clear of subsea assets.   Incident Summary: The Wachs cutter had completed its cut and was intact and operational at that point, the Wachs cutter was recovered to the work station on the main deck using the messenger line (not the crane), it was upon recovery to the work station that the guide bar was noted as being missing.  Immediate action taken: Client and the platform have been informed. The ROV carried out a search for the missing guide bar but was unable to locate it. The Wachs cutter scope is complete and will no longer be required on this project, therefore there will be no impact on the project.  Initial findings: There was no potential for injury as the divers were positioned above the Wachs cutter during the transfer. This event was recorded as an environmental event due to the fact that a PON 2 was submitted by the Platform The vessel position and the position of subsea assets, the distance of travel between the worksite and vessel mini,ised the potential of this event.  NB: The density of stainless steel varies depending on the specific alloy, but it's typically around 7.7 to 8.0 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3). For this calculation, we took the average value of 7.85 g/cm3.  The buoyancy effect of seawater needs to be considered. Seawater has a density of around 1.025 g/cm3.  The weight of an object is equal to its mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2).  To calculate the weight of 2.5 kg of stainless steel in seawater  Step 1: Volume = 2.5 kg ÷ 8000 kg/m3 = 0.0003125 m3  Step 2: Weight of seawater displaced = 0.0003125 m3 × 1025 kg/m3 ≈ 0.3203125 kg  Step 3: Weight of stainless steel in seawater = 2.5 kg - 0.3203125 kg ≈ 2.1796875 kg  Therefore, the weight of 2.5 kg of stainless steel in seawater is approximately 2.18 kg.

16186,"Brief account of the incident:  22:36/ 14 August 23; Task removing umbilical packers on aft reel, using pneumatic impact wrench, whilst working from man riding basket, in preparation for spooling operations.  Upon removing four umbilical bolt packers, using the pneumatic impact wrench, the final bolt (lower) was in the process of getting removed, which due to location of the impact wrench (foot level), it was not possible to  fully observe the tool and securing bolt. With the impact wrench secured onto the bolt of the umbilical packer, the tool was operated, with right hand on the deadman switch and left hand inadvertently on the revolving socket, (left hand was intended to be supporting tool).  As the IP commenced operating the tool, their impact glove got snagged in the revolving socket, resulting in the left thumb of the glove detached from the remainder of the glove.

157,"MTI - DEEP ORIENT– Laceration to finger whilst removing an empty aluminium can lid  Actions leading up to and including the incident: The Marine Deck crew had been tasked to conduct painting operations on deck. There was a requirement to provide a container to fill with methylated spirits to stow and clean the paint brushes being used for the task.  The Involved Person (IP) decided to utilise a used aluminium can for the job. A can was retrieved from the waste skip on the port side of the main deck. The aluminium can still had the lid partially attached.  The IP tried to remove the lid by pulling it away from the can with his hands. Due to the sharp edge of the lid the IP’s gloves were cut through. The lid caused a laceration to the inside of the middle finger, between the first and second knuckle on the IP’s left hand.  Initial action taken: The IP reported to the Medic for treatment. The Medic has cleaned the wound.  3 x sutures were applied to close the cut followed by a dressing.  The deck crew have been informed not to take any containers out of the bin or to use empty cans for containers.  A TOfS will be conducted to discuss the incident with the team and to prevent recurrence.  Initial findings: There were no suitable containers kept onboard for the task.

24575,"Sprinkle activated when removing load from rack.  Forklift driver was removing an alu.box from rack (movable racks) and the box hit the spinkler that was installed on the beam. The sprinkler system was activated.  Friday, 25.10.2024, around 17:40, we triggered the alarm in B16.  The forklift driver was supposed to lift an aluminum box from location B16R30A when he accidentally hit the sprinkler. As he lifted, he raised the aluminum box high enough so it hit the support beam, with only 8 cm clearance before lifting. I was standing in a lift next to the location and saw the incident. The forks were lowered again, but not enough. The aluminum box was still in contact with the sprinkler. He started to reverse, and I shouted STOP. He didn’t react quickly enough, so he dragged the sprinkler with him. The sprinkler was then triggered, and water sprayed out with considerable pressure, setting off the alarm. None of us knew where to shut off the sprinkler system.  CCB portvakt was notified at 17:42. They received the alarm and arrived quickly. The portvakt didn’t know where to shut down the sprinkler system in the building. I called caretaker 1 at 17:46 for information about the sprinkler system, but there was no answer. I called caretaker 2 at 17:47 for information about the sprinkler system, but there was no answer.  HSE Manager was called at 17:57, to inform him about the situation and to see if he knew who could be contacted about the system. He informed me that Facility Lead could be contacted, but I didn't have the nr.  We tried to shut off the valve in B15 together with portvakt, but nothing stopped. At 17:55, we still had full water pressure in B16. The portvakt was told on the phone that we needed to go to the pump house to stop it, but we couldn’t figure out the system. He had several phone and radio conversations. CCB Portvakt and TFMC two operators  were in the pump house, writing on the valve and pressing the stop button, but the system kept restarting. Safety Representative B14 called at 18:07 to say that the main switch was in B14. We went in and stopped it. 1 TFMC operator remained in the pump house and turn off the system when it restarted. TMFC operator read in the pump house that you need to hold the system button for 8 seconds to turn it off. That stopped it. HSE Manager wanted me to call with information, referring to the message at 18:02. I called him at 18:10 and updated him. We still had full pressure in the sprinkler. He informed me that VP Subsea Services  would come to assist. He also said I should remember to take some pictures. We managed to turn off the system around 18:15. The Portvakt spoke with caretaker 2 and got information on how the system works. The entire sprinkler system in our buildings now needs to be drained of water. B9 came to help with a collector and pump so we could pump the water out. We collected water in steel/wooden tubs and transported it out in shifts. There was a great effort from everyone/B9 with cans and pumps to help. Incredible team effort. The entire system is now turned off, so we won’t have a working system if a fire breaks out in B14-B18. CCB confirmed to the gatekeeper that this could remain off until Monday. Senior mngt will check on responsibility and insurance. Director Onshore Services called at 19:31 to check on the situation. I informed him about the situation, and we waited for the water to subside. At 19:46, I sent a message to Senior Mngt that the water had stopped. 1 TFMC operator had been in B9 and got a stop screw and screwed it into the sprinkler. I contacted portvakten at 19:49 to inform him that it had stopped, we had taken in all the hoses, and we locked down the building. They will make regular inspections throughout the night. An incredibly unfortunate situation, a bit chaotic at the start because no one knew where the shut-off valve was. The CCB portvakt was unfamiliar with the system, and people tried things we didn’t know. Here, I said STOP and that  we wouldn't proceed until we got any more information.

19023,"During the installation of bolts to attach the subsea lifting flange to the CMRT, a class 4 high torque wrench was used instead of a class 2 high torque wrench. And a pressure table for a class 2 key was applied and causing too high torque on bolt. When technician tightened all the bolts by 30%, 60% and 90% the bolt break before reaching 100%. As per torque table PRD-0000021662 the right torque for tightening should have been 1574Nm. From what we can see, the bolt brake at 3500Nm. The person who operated the high torque equipment has a flange pulling course/High torque course.  This case is much more serious than it appears at first glance. It is lifting equipment, and if the bolt had not broken, this equipment could have been sent out with stretched bolts and if we had not been lucky that the bolt broke.

8128,"Client: BP ANGOLA (BLOCK 18) B.V. ; Environmental Conditions:The incident occured at 05:30 on the 5th November 2021. The Skandi Vitoria was on DP, The sea was 1.4Hs, wind 5Kts S, visability was clear.Task / Actions Leading up to the Incident:At approx. 05:15 the aux line of the 250Te crane was recovered to deck from subsea with a subsea pennant and hook. Deck crew lowered the block to deck to enable the rigging to be back hooked to the block. In preparation for re-deployment subsea in approx. 30minutes.Incident / Initial Findings:The Rigging Supervisor instructed the crane operator to raise the boom and blocks to a safe height and could switch off for meal break.The crane operator then moved the crane to park on the boom rest, without any instruction or any deck crew observing the move. The crane operators main focus was on the main block as he knuckled in, ready to park on the boom rest. The crane operator didn’t realise the aux line raising in to the sheave. This resulted in the crane 110% alarm being activated. Time of Incident 05:30UPDATE 10.11.2021After investigation and received NOV data - the feedback from NOV after receiving the crane data, indicates that the AW wire was moving at approx. 37m/min at the time of impact and also that the hook stop was incorrectly set as the crane control system assumed there was another 1.4 mtrs to go. This cannot be attributed to the clash being due only to knuckling the boom. Extract from email from NOV Technical Advisor- A peak load of 30.8 ton on impact on the sheaves- Multiple movements was used at the time of impact. Main Boom Down, Knuckle Boom Inn and AW UP was is use at the time of impact - Speed of AW at the time of impact was approximately 37 m/m- We can see from the log that we have a wire pay out of 1.4m the time of impact. This indicates that the hook stop up, was set wrong or changed due to wire stretch. There is an alarm that reminds the operator to set the Hook stop Up if the hook has been submerged lower than 300 m. Alarm 160 ""Hook up limit may have changed AW""RCA ongoingReport ongoing 90% completeImmediate Actions taken:All stop, by the crane operator upon the 110% alarm being activated. Control notified.

13653,"Approx. 3 weeks ago during the Pipelay system load testing campaign, a roller bearing on the lower Tensioner was struck by a 500T shackle and damaged as pictured below. Upon removal of the load test pipe from Tensioners, a number of the small individual rollers dropped into the barriered off area below.  The unaccounted for rollers were suspected to have fallen into water at stern of vessel. The bearing arrangement consists of 2 rows of 38 rollers. The team have accounted 71 in total thus far.  While docked in the port of Limassol, the  construction team were working under Routine Dutie’s: DE-RD-PLY-019 (Hot work inside the Tower Work Stations) and DE-RD-PLY-009 (Rigging work in Tower or Gantries routing wires), TRA’s DE-TRA-PLY 4504 ?(Pipe removal from the Tower) and DE-TRA-PLY 2004 ( Rigging Operation on pipelay tower and spooling gantry platforms as part of the straightening trials for Karish North Field Development iEPCI.

All going well, at 09:35hrs the commencing of the pay out on the pipe took place until the tail head was located inside the upper work station. The construction team then arranged the removal of the rigging.   At 0940hrs the closure and squeeze of the lower tensioner took place and simultaneously the removal of the rigging from the A&R. While the rigger was located under the upper work station roof (out of the line of fire) he leaned 	forward to take hold of the A&R rigging, it was at this point he felt something brush his left shoulder.  An all stop was called and upon investigation it was noted that a small bearing roller weighing approx. 50 grams had dropped. The roller had dropped about 10m in height.

Upon completion of subsea preparation works, the recovery of ST-FX-6IN-9 was suspended due to forecasted increasing weather.  In anticipation of impending weather, additional tasks were identified that could be safely undertaken within operational limits. This included the cutting of jumper ST-FX-4IN-44, from H3 to H4 XT. Recovery of ST-FX-4IN-44 was discussed at the 0800am Offshore Leadership Team meeting (17th August 2024), Deep Orient morning meeting, HLDPR and shift plan.  At 19:23pm jumper ST-FX-4IN-44 was cut into approximately 5–5.5m sections in readiness for future recovery.  The following day, it was identified that jumper ST-FX-4IN-44 was not to be recovered until the Plug and Abandonment activities for associated XTs was performed. This was detailed in the Client Site Instruction (SI-011) issued on 9th April 2024.   Following confirmation that the line was not scheduled to be cut, the Deep Orient returned to Stybarrow field to perform visual inspection of the cut ends at H3 and H4 XT.   Initial findings at H4 identified small bubbles (est. 5mm) shedding every 10 seconds from what appear to be the annulus cavity between the flowline armour layer and outermost plastic sheathing. Deep Orient then relocated to H3 tree to the south and found there were nil visible leaks observed.   Note: As the discharge occurred before its intended time, the event has been recorded by TechnipFMC as a minor environmental release in alignment with the Global HSE Incident Classification Standard GPS-11-0017.    Immediate action taken: ?	Client and Onshore Perth team notified, ?	Vessel returned to Stybarrow field to performance visual inspection of the cut ends of H3 and H4 XT for leaks. ?	Updated vessel survey screen with no go lines highlighted in red. ?	WEL presentation (Stybarrow Flowlines Risers – Flushing and Disconnection – Gas Risk) and Site Instruction 011 and redistributed to offshore team. ?

19955,"Near miss - Environmental - Hose failure on the port side TTS crane  Background: The Skandi Africa is alongside in Acu port having completed the mobilisation of the LAPA 5 flowline and riser.  Actions leading up to and including the incident: The construction crew were using the portside TTS crane to load out rigging to be transferred to the North Sea Atlantic. On completion of the task a small leak was noticed coming from a hydraulic hose located on the TTS crane boom. At the time the boom was positioned at 35 degrees inwards to midships from the crane crutch. The leakage point at the hose located approximately 6m inside the deck on the portside.  The crane technician was immediately called to investigate and advise. The decision was made to return the crane boom to the crutch. As the crane was knuckled in a greater volume of oil escaped to the deck until the flow reduced to a drip when the boom was fully knuckled in. The boom was then slewed to port and returned to the crane crutch.    Immediate actions: SOPEP equipment was utilised to clean up oil spillages and placed under the crane boom. Bridge informed. Oil contained on the vessel and cleaned up. Estimated loss of hydraulic oil is approx. 5 x liters  Current findings: There was significant corrosion to the end fittings of the hydraulic hose. The crane has received 2 external inspections within the last 6 months which included the inspection of hydraulic hoses with no findings. The end fittings are protected with Denzo tape which prevents a visual inspection of the fitting unless removed and replaced. The position of the hose on the crane boom requires a scaffold to be erected to conduct an inspection - the area around the crane is often used for the stowage of project equipment preventing access for a scaffold tower to be constructed. The weekly inspection includes a visual inspection of the hydraulic hoses - it is impractical to expect that there will be access each week to the hydraulic hose located mid way on the crane boom.

14556,"Incident summary: During pipelay operations to deploy  Injection 5 umbilical UEH 9f, the pipelay operator situated in the pipelay control cabin noted that the low level alarm had activated on the main Hydraulic power unit (HPU). An available technician from the pipelay team was dispatched to check the HPU tank which was confirmed low. Further Investigations ensued and it was established that there was a leak in the vicinity of flap 1 operating cylinder. The exact time the leak started is unknown but it is thought to have started at some point in the last two weeks. It is estimated that approximately 45/50 litres of Shell Tellus 46 has been lost through the moonpool to sea during this time.  Initial Actions: ?	Operations stopped on flap one  ?	SOCS,CPE, Client, Bridge, Project Operations Manager and HSEA made aware   ?	PTW 3224 raised to access and install isolation valves onto the pressure and return lines.  ?	Investigation into the exact source of the leak.  Follow on Actions: Isolation vales installed  onto the pressure and return lines Risk assessment reviewed and updated to deploy product without  the use of flap one  Initial findings: The wiper seal on the cylinder rod is thought to have  failed due to fair wear and tear (approx. 10 years of use). There is a void space below the cylinder which has captured some of the oil estimated between 5/10 litres. No oil has been observed in the moonpool during 1st and second end umbilical deployment's. Cause – Failed hydraulic cylinder rod seal on Flap #1 of the Work Table, likely the failure due to age, similar incident previously on Flap #3.  One spare cylinder held shared between CDA and DST, removed unit from Flap #3 sent onshore for repair Dec 22 and haven’t received back onboard yet, due date end of June 23. Recommendations – Intention to replace the cylinder with a overhauled unit during the July maintenance period and send the removed cylinder for overhaul. Timeline – Unable to determine exactly when the leak started, the cylinder is not visible and cannot be inspected, the underside of the Work Table is inaccessible, approximation of no more than 14 days based on main HPU oil tank levels.  Indication of the leak was noted when a low level alarm indicated on the PLS SCADA system.   Resumo do incidente: Durante as opera??es de lan?amento de tubula??o para implantar UEH 9f umbilical de inje??o 5, o operador do pipelay situado na cabine de controle de instala??o de tubula??o notou que o alarme de nível baixo foi ativado na unidade de energia hidráulica (HPU) principal. Um técnico disponível da equipe de pipelay foi enviado para verificar o tanque da HPU, que foi confirmado como baixo. Investiga??es adicionais se seguiram e foi estabelecido que havia um vazamento nas proximidades do cilindro operacional da aba 1. A hora exata em que o vazamento come?ou é desconhecida, mas acredita-se que tenha come?ado em algum momento nas últimas duas semanas. Estima-se que aproximadamente 45/50 litros de Shell Tellus 46 foram perdidos através do moonpool para o mar durante este tempo.  Acoes iniciais:  ?   Opera??es iterrompidas no Flap #1  ?   SOCS, CPE, Cliente, Gerente de Opera??es do Projeto e HSEA avisados. ?   Permiss?o de trabalho 3224 emitida para o acesso e isolamento das válvulas das linhas de press?o e retorno.  ?

12009,"Operations prior to discovery: The Deep Star was conducting Pipelay operations and transfer of the 1st end top riser had been completed. One of the PLS technicians was tasked with conducting routine maintenance at the top of the PLS tower  Summary of finding: At approximately 11.00am during maintenance duties on top of the PLS top sheeve forward drive system. The PLS technician noticed that the drive wheel had broken up and was now situated in the containment tray approximately 900mm below. The wheel had broken up into 5 separate pieces. The wheel is made up of 4 separate sections, all sections were accounted for with one section breaking into two pieces culminating into the 5 pieces recovered from the containment tray. Initial action taken: ?	All pieces secured in a plastic bag and taken down to deck. ?	Area checked for other potential dropped objects and confirmed all pieces of the drive wheel were accounted for. ?	CPE Informed. ?	OCM, Client, Project and HSEA made aware.  ?	Investigation Initiated.  Initial findings: Still unclear why the damage occurred but it is thought it happened during or after completing the transfer of the 1st end top riser. Various measurements have been taken to assess the potential for any of the pieces to fall to deck. The containment tray in place below the drive wheel successfully collected all pieces from the drive wheel as is its purpose. There are gaps situated around the containment tray which should be covered to prevent any objects in the future  dropping through to the deck below. During assessment for potential dropped objects object 5 was the only piece deemed with any potential to drop through one of the gaps. The largest gap along one side of the containment tray is 90mm with the dimensions of piece 5 at 230mm long – 88m wide on one side and 75mm on the other and around 60mm thick.  The containment tray has a 80mm edge around the perimeter. After analysis it was concluded that, although piece 5 theoretically would fit through the gap in certain orientations, the likelihood of this happening was extremely remote as the object would have to land in an exact orientation, without contacting any surface to be able to pass through the gap.

In preparation of the 8inch PLA08 flowline subsea installation, ROV (UHD 23) made accidental contact with a hydraulic control line (HW443) while making a planned grab for the ROV handle on the PLA manifold on Hydraulic Flow Line (HFL) at MCQ4 hub.  The ROV initial intended to grab the horizontal bar on the north face of the Pluto manifold however, there was not a suitable position to achieve good line of site with both cameras and therefore had to opt for the vertical grab handle on the northeast corner. ROV handles on this manifold are clearly identified with being painted Orange in colour. In the process of grabbing the handle, the ROV five function manipulator (Rigmaster) has made contact with a hydraulic control line which, is exposed by design, to the south of the handle.   As a consequence of the contact, the control line has had a loss of containment and internal fluid has been released to the environment.

Skandi Africa was currently in the recovery process of the Riser 10 flowline.   Gas checks and NORM checks were completed as per procedure before the removal of each anode.   It was noted that some weeping of oil were noted at the outer sheath holes after the removal of the anodes.   Description of incident:  IP is responsible for the installation of TRACON/Repair clamps. Repair clamps are fitted around the flexible outer sheath and are used to seal off the outer sheath vent holes  He installed 3 x repair clamps on the 2nd end of Riser 10 flowline.   IP was wearing the required eye protection (safety glasses) during the installation.   But as there is air and wave movement at the moonpool, it creates wind that escapes via the moonpool door opening where the flowline is in place.   He alleges that this “breath of air” could have caused some of the discharges (not clear on what exactly is the cause - oily water discharges, crude oil discharge, water from the moonpool) enter his eye bypassing or bouncing off his safety glasses  At that time, he did not feel any irritation and continued working until the completion of the 3 x clamps.    On the 24th of October around 0645 hrs, IP came to see the Doctor/ medic onboard complaining of irritation and swelling of the left upper eyelid.

MPS ROV was at a depth of 1967 Meters connected to the buoyancy rigging to disconnect the buoyancy from the TRF. Whilst trying to untangle the rigging there was excessive strain on the 5 Function manipulator due to vessel heave and the Buoyancy uplift. This resulted with the mechanical sheer pin on the manipulator sheering and causing damage to the hose. This incident caused an oil loss of 2.6 litres. The oil lost to the sea was Mobile10XL46  O Deep Blue está operando no campo Mero 2 na localiza??o 24o 37' 48” S 042o 15' 42"" W -  Vento de 110 o Velocidade do vento 11 Knts, visibilidade muito boa. O ROV MPS estava a uma profundidade de 1.967 metros conectado ao equipamento de flutua??o para desconectar a flutuabilidade do TRF. Ao tentar desembara?ar o cordame, houve tens?o excessiva no manipulador de 5 fun??es devido ao levantamento da embarca??o e à eleva??o da flutuabilidade. Isso resultou no rompimento do pino de cisalhamento mecanico do manipulador, causando danos à mangueira. Este incidente causou uma perda de óleo de 2,6 litros. O petróleo perdido para o mar foi Mobile10XL46.   Current situation/Initial actions taken?   The Captain, OCM, and Client has been informed onboard.  Flew ROV back to the ROV garage, Recovered ROV to deck, changed sheer pin, replaced manipulator, hose topped up compensators and carried out deck checks.  O Capit?o, OCM e Cliente foram informados a bordo.

14291,"Environmental conditions: The  Deep Star Is currently in Brazil carrying out he Mero1F2+ project situated in the Mero 1 field.   Task leading up to the Incident: The IP was assisting his supervisor carryout Inspection of a class 4 torque tool which was situated on the floor of the ROV workshop.   Incident Summary: Following Inspection the two ROV team members decided to lift the torque tool weighing 30kg and position it on the workbench Immediately next to the tool position. During the final moments of the lift while placing the tool onto the bench the IP felt a sharp pain in his back.   Initial action taken: The IP Stated he felt discomfort in his back following the manual handling activity but not enough to warrant seeking the medic. (see witness testimony in documents). 3 hours later following his meal the IP felt his condition was deteriorating so he decided to attend the vessel medic. The medic examined the IP and issued some over the counter pain killers in the form of Paracetamol to help alleviate any pain. The Deep Star captain, OCM and HSE Technician were all informed.    Initial findings: IP stated correct manual handling techniques were adopted while carrying out the task and the lift was performed by two personnel. The day before the IP had felt some discomfort in his back but thought this was due to normal muscle pain from a previous gym workout the day before  (see witness testimony in documents). IP also attended the medic on the 17th of April with a concern about numbness in his left hand, he was advised by the medic that if it got worse or he was in pain to immediately come back and see him. IP stated on the morning of the 18th he felt fine with no pain or concerns about his back or left hand. Approximately 3 hours into his shift on the 18th the IP felt a sharp pain in his back following a routine manual handling task.   Condi??es ambientais: A Deep Star está atualmente no Brasil realizando o projeto Mero1F2+ situado no campo Mero 1.  Tarefa que antecedeu o Incidente: O colaborador  estava ajudando seu supervisor a realizar a inspe??o de uma ferramenta de torque classe 4 que estava situada no piso da oficina do ROV.  Resumo do incidente: Após a inspe??o, os dois membros da equipe do ROV decidiram levantar a ferramenta de torque pesando 30 kg e posicioná-la na bancada imediatamente ao lado da posi??o da ferramenta. Durante os momentos finais do levantamento, ao colocar a ferramenta na bancada, o colaborador  sentiu uma dor aguda nas costas.  A??o inicial tomada: O colaborador  informou  que sentiu desconforto nas costas após a atividade de manuseio manual, mas n?o o suficiente para justificar a procura do médico. (ver depoimentos de testemunhas nos documentos). 3 horas depois de sua refei??o, o colaborador  sentiu que sua condi??o estava piorando, ent?o ele decidiu comparecer ao médico do navio. O médico examinou o colaborador  e prescreveu alguns analgésicos  e  de paracetamol para ajudar a aliviar qualquer dor. O capit?o do Deep Star, o OCM e o técnico de HSE foram todos informados.  Descobertas iniciais: O colaborador  informou  que técnicas corretas de manuseio manual foram adotadas durante a execu??o da tarefa e o i?amento foi realizado por duas pessoas. No dia anterior, o IP sentiu algum desconforto nas costas, mas pensou que isso se devia a uma dor muscular normal de um treino de academia  no dia anterior (ver depoimento de testemunha nos documentos). Colaborador também foi no médico no dia 17 de abril com uma preocupa??o sobre dormência na m?o esquerda, ele foi avisado pelo médico que se piorasse ou ele estivesse com dor para voltar imediatamente para vê-lo.

1642,"At about 02:45 this morning, May 8, the TFMC team were working to install a THHT (Tubing Hanger Handling Tool) into a recovered TH (Tubing Hanger).  As the technician was inspecting the threads on a service bar used for the installation, he ran his thumb across them to clean off the dirt – He was wearing leather-palmed impact gloves, as well as latex gloves underneath – and a metal burr from the threads pierced my glove and punctured my thumb.    This did not appear to be a great issue.  Upon removing his glove he found no blood and I could not find a puncture wound.  He informed the Hess DSV that was on the rig floor what had happened and he asked if he needed to see the medic.   He let him know that he did not think this was necessary.  He then told the technician that he would inform Hess HSE, as this is the Hess policy.  He called the HSE rep at about 05:00 and the HSE rep requested that the technician come see him when he was finished working outside.

15258,"After completion of a frac stage, IP(Contractor) was notified that a frac pump needed to be rigged in after maintenance. The pump was spotted close to the final position. Due to the LineLock hose not aligning properly, the pump needed to be slightly adjusted so the LineLock hose could be connected. IP and TFMC FST were standing on the pump, with the IP bracing the LineLock hose as the pump was moved backwards. The backwards motion while repositioning the pump exceeded the planned distance and the stopping motion caused the flange portion of the hose to slip off the connection point on the pump. The stored energy released and the hose moved to its natural position resulting in the hose to swing towards the pump. As a result, the IP's right index finger was caught between the steel hose connection, just above the flange, and the connection point on the pump. Site Supervision was notified.

24660,"?	On 2 November 2024, the Olympic Triton, engaged in the Statfjord A Decommissioning Project, was operating within the 500m zone of Statfjord A to conduct a debris survey of the spool route. ?	At approximately 1724 the WROV C07 was returning to deck due to increase in weather, As the WROV was just inside the hanger there was a leak with the valve pack causing hydraulic fluid to be discharged into the WROV drip tray, at no time was any oil discharged elsewhere. ?	The WROV managed to be landed safely and secured before the team began fault finding the issue and cause. ?	It was discovered that the leak of hydraulic oil had come from a dislodged ‘O’ ring and a bent valve backing plate. The plate was straightened and the ‘O’ ring reinstalled. The system was pressure tested OK and the cause of the leak further investigated.  ?	Investigation revealed LARS System lost between 40-50 liters of hydraulic oil. ?	After further investigation it was found that the isolation valve that is mounted on the return line of the hydraulic system was closed during the recovery of the ROV when it should have been open during launch and recovery operations. The valve is equipped with a microswitch to lock the start button and prevent the HPU from starting when closed, a test on this valve showed that the microswitch was sticking indicating that the valve is in an Open position and this enabled the HPU to be started when the valve was closed, leading to an increase in pressure on the valve pack dislodging the ‘O’ ring and causing the leak. ?

10173,"Environmental conditions: The Deep Blue is at Theodore spoolbase, weather dry and sunny.  Wind was 8 knots from the west.   Events leading up to the incident: The rigging team were embarking 14 inch rigid pipe.  The team had just located the spooling elbow into the stbd reel and the 80mm end cap had been fitted. The reel was then rotated in order to bring the pipe onto the vessel.  Incident: At approx. 13.00 hrs it was reported there was damage to the access step on the stbd reel elbow end securing . The step is approx. 150mm wide and 1000mm long  and is connected to number 1 crane pedestal.  It hinges on 2 brackets and is stored in an upright position when spooling.  An 80mm endcap for the pipe elbow had been fitted and appears that this had caught the platform when rotating the reel  Immediate actions taken: All stop was called and the damaged platform removed.  Spooling was stopped for approximately 15 minutes to remove the platform and inspect the end cap for damage  Notes: There was no damage to the end cap although there are some scraping marks.  There was no potential harm to personnel or the environment.  If the step had come off of the crane pedestal it would have fallen to the reel well which is a no go area. (Hard barriered off with signage.) As we were embarking 14 inch rigid pipe a bigger elbow is fitted to the pipe and therefore an 80mm end cap was needed.  It is thought that It is the first time an 80mm end cap has been used since the step had been replaced. The step is used for access to fit the stbd reel end cap The design of the step for the port reel differs from the stbd. Therefore there is no potential for the same to happen on that side.

Part of this task included the fitting and torquing of a greyloc connector to the flexible. A pre-installed engineered working platform had been setup to allow safe access to the table providing a stable working platform for teams to operate around the product. To complete the greyloc connection the team were using an impact wrench to set the connector in place before applying the torque tool for the 3 passes necessary up to the approved torque setting as per procedure. The crew member was one of the VLS team who was operating the impact wrench to set the connector when he felt a pain, discomfort in his right elbow. The crew member switched position and change grip on the tool and continued with the operation. On completion of the task the tools were packed away and the crew member was making his way aft on the portside for his next task when he reached out with his right hand to steady himself as he stepped over some equipment and experienced a sharp pain in the same right elbow.

18581,"Prior to this incident occurring, Vallourec Tubular Solutions of Brazil (Pipe manufacturer) had transported 1381 joints of 14” 3LPP coated line pipe to the Port of Vitoria for temporary storage, prior to onward shipping to Evanton Spool base, UK. Offloading and storage stacking began on the 20th of December and concluded on the 23rd of December 2023. Vallourec supervised the stacking operations which were executed by the Port Authority workers (Login TVV) in accordance with the Vallourec Operating Procedure which stated that the pipe was to be stacked 9 layers high to a height of circa 2.5 meters.   At 1500 hours on the 28th of December 2023, the Vallourec transport provider ‘Login TVV’ (Port Authority) identified via CCTV footage that the first storage stack area had collapsed, and various joints of line pipe had rolled across the hard standing. The Port Authority subsequently notified Vallourec and confirmed that the incident had occurred. No personnel were nearby at the time of the occurrence and as such no injury to personnel occurred. However, there were no mitigations (hard barriers) placed in the area by the Port Authority to protect personnel from harm should they have had cause to be in the vicinity at the time of the stack collapse.  TechnipFMC had raised concerns with Vallourec regarding the stack height but were assured that this was compliant with Brazilian guidance.  No further action was taken.  Vallourec confirmed 9 layers was normal procedure and followed the guidelines of ABNT NBR 16212:2013 Standard – Pipes Storage in Discovered Area. Engineering calculations provided by Vallourec also showed that the stack was within the safe working capacity. Vallourec confirmed the stacking arrangement had been utilised on many projects without incident for temporary storage. Vallourec also confirmed that the stack height would be acceptable and that working at height arrangements would be put in place to mitigate the risk. Vallourec also detailed that due to the storage arrangements being temporary, end posts could not be utilised, and metallic end stops would have to be used.   This was accepted by both Shell and TFMC. Delivery of the pipe to the port began on the 20th of December and was concluded on the 23rd of December without issue.  **  TFMC have circulated a Duty of Care / One Pager docuement outlining the incident and the lessons learned to all Projects.

23228,"The vessel is currently tied up in Le Trait on the river Seine, we have just finished the maintenance period and started the mobilisation for GiroFlow yesterday.  At 13:00 the Skandi Africa was passed on the port side by the MV Wellpark.  The MV Wellpark is a bulk carrier with a cargo capacity of some 46,000 tons and a draft of 9.5 metres.  The vessel passed us within 50 metres at a speed of 9 knots causing a bow wave that unfortunately buffeted the Skandi Africa, causing the vessel to pull away from the quayside.  This imposed force put excessive strain on the forward springs.  The spring was doubled up and at 13:11 one of the lines failed at the fairlead onboard and separated with a loud banging noise and appeared to recoil in the direction of the quayside. Approximately ten seconds later the second spring failed at the fairlead and again appeared to recoil in the direction of the quayside. The vessel now started to drift on the headline and the bow started to move away from the jetty.  The vessel has a forward and midships gangway configuration, at this point the gangways started to move on their rollers located on the quayside. The bridge engaged thrusters to counter the vessel moving way away from the jetty and bring it back alongside.  The gangway rollers now started to move back to there original position. A pallet with items was butted up to the end of the midships gangway at the quayside end. It appears that the momentum of the vessel coming back alongside has caused the rollers to stop moving as they have made contact with the pallet, and load has been applied at the weakest point of the gangway which is the hooks that attach over the ships side, causing one of the aluminium hooks to fail and in effect making the entire gangway unserviceable.

22104,"Environmental Conditions: The vessel was in infield at position 46° 47.3’ N  048° 01.0’W at the time of the event with the following environmental conditions recorded: Wind Speed: 12kts Wind Direction:171° Sea state: HS: 1.5m Direction: 220°  Task / Actions Leading up to the Incident: At the time of the incident the vessel was on Dive No 51 conducting subsea operations on the subsea buoy for the West White Rose project. Working depth was between 34-39 metres.   Dive team 1 had recently completed the milling of bumper pad casting No22 and recovered the milling machine to deck and had just completed the ACFM (alternating current field measurement) inspection of casting No22. The next step of the operation was to de-rig the work site and recover the subsea work platform and tooling to deck.  Incident / Initial Findings:. In preparation for the recovery of the work platform, the ROV had been requested by the Dive Supervisor to carry out a visual inspection of the sky hook the rigging and lift bag. At approximately 13:20hrs the Dive Supervisor instructed the Divers to connect the work station to the pre-installed sky hook and rigging in preparation for recovery. 13:28hrs the crane was lowered to depth, monitored by XLX 126. Once the work station was connected to the sky hook rigging, a request was made to the Dvr’s to come up on the chain hoist and take the weight of the work platform on to the sky hook and rigging. This transferred the weight of the work platform from the four Dyneema chains suspended from the trunnions to the sky hook and rigging allowing the Dyneema chains to be disconnected. The outer most left hand chain was disconnected first followed by the outer most right hand chain, the inner left hand chain was next to be disconnected. As Diver two released the fourth Dyneema chain in sequence from the inner right hand trunnion at 13:30hrs he reported that the work platform and sky hook were dropping. The Dive Supervisor immediately told both Dvr’s to “let it go and let the strops take the weight”. The work platform descended approximately 6 metres and came to stop on the pre-installed sky hook hold back rigging.  Dive Supervisor checked that both Dvr’s were all clear and ok and that everything was secure. As the crane was already at depth at 13:32hrs Dvr 2 was instructed to connect the crane to the work platform. 13:34hrs the crane was connected in preparation for the recovery to deck of the work platform. 13:48hrs the work platform was recovered to deck.  Current Situation/ Initial Actions taken:. OCM, HSE, Captain and Clients informed. Investigation initiated.  Actions: TOFS completed with all four Dive Teams with their respective Supervisors.  Subsequent Actions: During Dive 55 Dive Team 1 Supervisor requested that an inspection of the Sky hook and rigging be completed by the divers - X5 Champagne leaks identified in the lift bag - Lift bag swapped out.  Comment 1: The sky hook and associated rigging were installed by Team 1 on Dive 43 on the 28.06.24 at approximately 12:20hrs. The next time they were required for use was on Dive 51.

15692,"I was operating the loader during the process of picking up iron dayshift had rigged down around 18:30 on Sunday July 16, 2023. After 2 coworkers and I finished picking up the iron that was by the open top tank I then drove the loader over to the next pile of iron that we had to pick up near the desanders. Around 19:25 I positioned it in a spot where we could load all of our iron off the ground into the bucket without having to re-maneuver it, put it in neutral, engaged the parking brake, turned it off, climbed down the steps and started to load iron. I asked the orange hat to help me pick up a 3"" plug valve after we had picked up a couple other pieces of iron. He told me he ""wasn't fucking picking anything up"" and asked if I ""had a valve bar"". I told him no, asked him to grab one side of said valve and I would grab the other so we could lift it together into the bucket. He reiterated that he wasn't ""fucking picking anything up"" and walked away. I then proceeded to pick up the valve, walk it over to the loader bucket (approximately 3 to 5ft.) and in the process of transferring it into the bucket, my right hand slipped on the grease inside the valve and the valve swung towards the bucket of the loader and crushed my hand in between the valve and the cutting edge of the loader bucket. The valve dropped on the ground. I held my hand because obviously it hurt. I then proceeded to ask the orange hat again if he could help me lift it into the bucket. At this point he agreed. We picked it up, put it into the bucket, and then proceeded to pick up the rest of the iron. I then climbed back into the loader, put my seat belt on, turned it on, disengaged the parking brake, looked behind me and out both sides of the window, put it into reverse, backed out of the area I was in and drove the loader over to the 2"" and 3"" pipe skids so that we could transfer the iron out of the bucket into its respective skid.

7955,"Involved person (IP) was conducting mobilization activities for a seal replacement tool as per FAT procedure 100046096-FAT and under instruction of service order 1778197.IP completed mechanical inspections and proceeded to function test requirement as per 100046096-FAT, Section 4.2.1 Function Test of Tool Frame. For Step 2 to be completed, hydraulic pressure application was affected via portable HPU through ROV Hot Stab to activate cylinders that stroke the carrier plate within the tool frame.During this step, the IP identified incorrect configuration of hydraulic hoses from hot stab to hub cylinder ports A and B (SN to be raised). While not critical to FAT and not a causal factor to the event, the incorrect hose configuration would only serve to reverse cylinder stroke.IP continued activities per FAT 4.2 to verify configuration. During pressurization, IP attempted to manually regulate the pressure from the HPU using the HPU ball valve. At full extension of the cylinder stroke, IP observed the pressure gauge to exceed 200bar, which caused a breach of the braided hydraulic B line. This case is a type of Accident.

To do so, the head of the pin is rigged and lifted. The other extremity is laid down a wooden wedge. When the lifting started, the injured person (IP) noticed that the threaded part of the pin was about to scrub the ground. To avoid any damage to the threaded part, the IP set his right hand bellow the pin to support the lifting. The pin felt from its position on the wooden wedge and hurt the hand of the IP. He immediately removed his hand but felt a pain. The IP checked his hand and saw 2 wounds, one per finger (index, middle).   First action  Our first aider escorted him to our nursery where he received a first medical treatment (cleaning of the wound and a bandage). He went back to nursary minutes after as he noticed the pain was higher. He received a second treatment based on cold strips.  Current status of the IP The IP turned home.

10369,"Environmental Conditions: ?             Wind: 090° x 9 Knots ?             Wave 3 / 4.8 metres ?            Current: 310° / 2 Knot  Task Leading up to the Incident:  At the time of the Incident the ROV directed by the OCS were tasked with connecting two X RUD hooks to x 2 buoyancy modules one hook per buoy before cutting the  Polly prop rope to release the buoys from their anchor position onto the crane rigging for recovery.  Description/summary of Incident:  During the buoy recovery operations the hooks were connected to both buoys and after checking that the hooks were correctly installed to the rigging, the poly-prop cuts were made to release the  first buoy from its anchors.  While waiting for visibility to check the cut/setup for the next buoy, the Bridge reported that a buoy was spotted on the water surface at 18:08 hours.   Initial Action taken: ?	Bridge reported that the Buoy was seen at the surface  ?	The ROV video was checked and it was clearly observed that the buoy was no longer connected to the hook ?	OCM, HSE Tech and Client Informed ?	Maritime observation form issued to alert other vessels in the area ?	HSE Tech Initiated an Investigation  Initial findings: On review of the ROV footage both hooks look to be connected with no obstructions or anomalies. Further footage shows just before the final cut that the RUD hook is connected but is also lying on its side with potentially one side of the release catch depressed. This is because the order in which the ropes were cut (1 and 2 first) meant that the Buoy flipped almost 90 degrees as it was still secured by one rope (rope 3).  The position of the crane in relation meant the rigging became caught below a master link resulting in the resting position of the hook being on the top corner of the Buoy. (see story board) Video footage also shows the ROV adjusting its position while holding the RUD hook. During this footage one side is depressed first but both latches make a movement. Only two RUD hook have been available since the start of project and no maintenance or equipment function checks are known to be routinely carried out. This was a recovery operation of client Buoyancy the two buoys are separated and recovered with only one hook per Buoy . TFMC Buoyancy is joined together meaning there is a secondary hook used for recovery.   - Hook B certification expired on 17/09/2022 Hook E expires on 08/12/22. On recovery both RUD hooks were Inspected and found to be defective. Partial opening occurs when one latch is depressed this is evident on both hooks. Report to be added to case  Condi??es ambientais: ? Vento: 090° x 9 Nós ? Onda 3 / 4,8 metros ? Corrente: 310° / 2 nós  Tarefa que levou ao incidente: No momento do incidente, o ROV dirigido pelo OCS foi encarregado de conectar dois ganchos X RUD a x 2 módulos de flutua??o, um gancho por bóia, antes de cortar o cabo de sustenta??o Polly para liberar as bóias de sua posi??o de ancoragem no equipamento do guindaste para recupera??o.  Descri??o/resumo do Incidente: Durante as opera??es de recupera??o das bóias os ganchos foram ligados a ambas as bóias e após verifica??o da correta instala??o dos ganchos no cordame, foram feitos os cortes do polyprop para libertar a primeira bóia das suas ancoras. Enquanto aguardava visibilidade para verificar o corte/configura??o da próxima bóia, a Ponte informou que uma bóia foi avistada na superfície da água às 18:08 horas.  A??o inicial tomada: ? A Ponte informou que a Bóia foi vista na superfície ? O vídeo do ROV foi verificado e foi claramente observado que a bóia n?o estava mais conectada ao gancho ? OCM, o HSE e Cliente Informado ? Formulário de observa??o marítima emitido para alertar outras embarca??es na área ? O HSE iniciou uma investiga??o  Achados iniciais: Na revis?o da filmagem do ROV, ambos os ganchos parecem estar conectados sem obstru??es ou anomalias. Mais imagens mostram pouco antes do corte final que o gancho RUD está conectado, mas também está deitado de lado com potencialmente um lado da trava de libera??o pressionado. Isso ocorre porque a ordem em que as cordas foram cortadas (1 e 2 primeiro) significava que a Bóia virou quase 90 graus, pois ainda estava presa por uma corda (corda 3). A posi??o do guindaste em rela??o significava que o cordame ficou preso abaixo de um elo mestre, resultando na posi??o de repouso do gancho no canto superior da bóia. (veja o storyboard) As imagens de vídeo também mostram o ROV ajustando sua posi??o enquanto segura o gancho RUD. Durante esta filmagem, um lado é pressionado primeiro, mas ambas as travas fazem um movimento. Apenas dois ganchos RUD est?o disponíveis desde o início do projeto e nenhuma manuten??o ou verifica??es de funcionamento do equipamento s?o realizadas rotineiramente. - A certifica??o Hook B expirou em 17/09/2022 e o Hook E ira expira em 08/12/22.Na recupera??o, ambos os ganchos RUD foram inspecionados e considerados defeituosos. A abertura parcial ocorre quando uma trava é pressionada, isso é evidente em ambos os ganchos. Relatório a ser adicionado ao caso This case is a type of Near Miss.

13286,"IP (TFMC mobilisation supervisor) fell circa 4m from height (ladder) during mobilization of Osprey Vessel (Eemslift Ellen) whilst moored alongside in Aviles Port, Spain.  At the time and date stated, the IP was on board an Osprey Vessel (Eemslift Ellen) in Spain, during which time the IP fell 4m from a ladder. The IP slipped on a wet rung as it had been raining heavily. The IP was alone and there were no witnesses to the actual fall. Colleagues had heard a loud noise, called out to the IP to ask if he was okay and he responded yes. Using the same ladder, the IP climbed from the cargo hold where he rejoined his colleagues on the tween deck who noticed the IP in pain. As a result of the fall, the IP was taken to hospital (San Agustin - Aviles) where following examination, it was confirmed that he has sustained a fractured pelvis. Medical professionals that assessed the IP believed in Aviles, that the injury should heal without the need for any invasive medical procedures/operations, however, on the transferring to hospital in Cyprus a second opinion believes that an operation would be the best course of action to heal faster and more effectively. The IP underwent surgery on 9th March, all went well and the IP is in a stable condition. The recovery time is 6-8 weeks.    The ladder was temporarily fixed to the vessel structure with ratchet straps and had no vertical cage (backscratcher) and working at height equipment/100% tie-off was not employed. The ladder was put on the vessel 3/4 days prior (17th February 2023) to the IP falling at an initial mobilisation at Invergordon, Scotland. Following mobilisation of equipment at Invergordon, it was identified that the three main access / egress to the cargo hold were all blocked and could not be used.  A ladder was thereafter put in place by the vessel crew, which was secured using ratchet straps.  The ladder was circa 5m in height. The load plan for this mobilisation was produced by Osprey and signed off by TFMC project team. No access restrictions were identified during the review of the load plan. Following installation, the ladder was used at Invergordon by all personnel accessing the cargo hold from the Tween Deck. The IP was alone and there was no witnesses to the actual fall.    - No management of change process was followed for the use of the ladder.  - There was no risk assessment for this task.  - No working at height mitigations applied.  - There was no barriers, safe access and egress or safety signage. - The IP was alone and there was no witnesses to the actual fall. - No ISPS or other statutory controls to receive visitors were in place on board the vessel.

The forklift involved is number 84 (15 ton), which is equipped with alarm in the seat, causing the alarm to go off when the operator release weight from the seat. When the alarm went off the operator got back in the seat and engaged the handbreak before leaving the forklift. Since the alarm went off before fully raising his body from the seat, he never left the seat properly. During test off the alarm on February 27th the alarm worked properly, and due to the heavy weight of the forklift making it move slowly the forklift moved only a few cm before operator engaged the handbreak. Personnel inside the workshop was at safe distance from the forklift, no risk for personnel or damage to equipment.   During interviews with the warehouse operator, it seem that the operator pressed the wrong button to engage the handbrake, and instead of pressing the button for the handbreak he pressed the similar button to set the forks to locked position.

I denne plastikk isolatoren, s? finnes det et hull. I dette hullet s? skal det g? en guide pin. Denne guide pin blir f?rst dunket p? plass i SCM base plate. Guide pin hadde g?tt halvveis inn, og tenkte at dette var langt nok. Ec blir da skubbet p? plass p? lokasjonen sin , det manglet 1 mm f?r EC bunnet flush med base plate. Ecene var trange ? montere. Satt s? i de fire titan boltene, og skrudde litt p? hver bolt, slik at EC skulle bunne helt. Jeg brukte momentn?kkel p? 4 nm, og tenkte om ikke EC g?r videre oppover, s? vil momentn?kkel sl? ut veldig fort. Boltene roterte rundt uten ? komme opp i 4 nm, og tenkte da at n? g?r EC oppover p? plass. Mens jeg skrur p? en av boltene, s? ligger momentn?kkelen p? rundt 3.5 nm i kraft. ( Digital momentn?kkel) Det som da skjer er at det plastikken eksploderer, og det plastikkbiter flyger i alle retninger rundt hvor jeg satt. Det gikk bra. Teorien er da at guide pin skulle v?rt enda lenger inne i hullet sitt. For det som n? har skjedd er at guidepin har bunnet i plastikk isolatoren, og i mens man har skrudd p? boltene, s? har denne guide pin presset seg inn i plastikk isolator, som til slutt resulterte i at plastikken sprengte.

21127,"Deep Orient was on location at the Enfield decommissioning site, conducting subsea flowline recovery operations for client Woodside.  Whilst conducting visual checks of the crane , the Crane Technician observed a broken bolt attached to the rope guard on the auxiliary winch tip sheaves of the NOV Crane. After investigation, fresh impact damage to the VLS gutter deflector was also observed. There is yellow paint, consistent of the gutter deflector scuffed on to the knuckle of the crane. This would indicate that there has been contact between the crane and the VLS gutter deflector.   The knuckle section of the NOV crane was lowered to the main deck and inspected. It was found that the bolt from the aux wire guard had sheared off and was hanging from the bolt hole in the guard. The nut and tail portion of the bolt have been sheared off and not recovered.  After the inspection, the broken bolt was replaced, and crane returned to service. A sweep of the deck and the VLS has taken place to locate the sheared bolt end and nut however, these items have not been found. It is unknown when the damage occurred.  Three things arise from this event. 1. Impact between the crane and VLS deflector 2. Dropped object being the nut and tail of the bolt 3 Near miss from the potential for the bolt remaining in the wire guard hole to drop.  The initial incident in this case is the NOV crane making contact with the VLS gutter deflector causing superficial damage to the deflector. This event is treated as an accident which triggers two consequences as a result on the contact.  1. The first consequence is a dropped object event from the sheared bolt end and nut falling 25m to deck level. The estimated weight of the dropped object is 211g. The weight and height of the dropped object is know from the marks on the VLS deflector and is calculated as minor on the drops calculator. 2. The second consequence is a near miss due to the potential for the remaining section of the bolt that has remained inside the guard to fall out of the guard hole to the deck. The weight of remaining bolt part is 392g and gives a dropped object rating of major.  Review of the risk matrix for the accident event of crane impacting  the VLS deflector plate is rated 1 being a 1 for severity as the damage was limited to a sheared bolt. The accident is given a possible rating for likelihood of 1 as this is the first time the crane has made contact with the VLS in two years.   Review of the risk matrix for the dropped nut and bolt end when reviewing likelihood and severity gives a drops rating of 8. This comprises a 2 for severity based on the drops calculator and a three (possible) as the likelihood.  Review of the risk matrix for the near miss potential of the bolt falling out of the guard hole is 16. This is based on a severity of 3 based on drops calculator and a likelihood of a 3 due to probability of 10-30% chance of occurrence. This case is a type of Accident. The type of impact specified is Damage - Financial impact. The description of the severity selected in the Risk Matrix is 1 - Negligible. The severity value for this case is 1.0.

Had first tried screwing 2 lifting lugs into the lifting holes that are on the ITC body, but thought this was not safe in view of the fact that it would spin around very quickly since the center of gravity. After placing the ITC down on the pallet again, I removed the lifting strap and asked a member of staff for help. Was it a lifting strap that I had forgotten to remove from the lifting eye. Employees then began to show how he wanted to lift, when he had made it ready to lift, I quickly lifted up while a strap was still hanging in the lifting eye. This then resulted in the ITC being overturned very quickly and uncontrolled. The ITC overturned and broke the pallet it was standing on first and then wobbled a lot before hitting the ground.

10960,"Near Miss- 082157C001- Repsol TVIT - Deep Discoverer - 22.Oct.22 - Divers hat descends 50-100mm on to divers head  Environmental conditions: Wave 2.2M Significant with a max of 3.6 Wind 13 knots, 105 degrees Working depth of the divers 131, the depth of the bell will have been approximately    Task / actions leading up to the incident: Dive #68 Diver 1 had returned to the bell for a refreshment break, during the break one of the hoses on the dive hat for diver 1 was to be changed, the dive hat was lowered slightly on the lifting pulley system by the bellman to reduce the tension on the hoses, the rope for the pulley system was locked in the cam locks but had not been tied off.  During the hose change the rope was inadvertently knocked out of the cam lock, due to the fact that the rope was not tied off the dive hat descended approximately 50 to 100 mm on to the divers head, this resulted in no physical injury requiring treatment, just redness on the scalp of the head  Current situation/Initial actions taken: The situation was discussed with the bellman and diver #1 and the response was that there was an area of redness but it was not a problem and that diver #1 was OK to continue and did not require any treatment.  Immediate Actions: Once back in the water the dive supervisor confirmed with diver #1 that they were OK and confirmation was given that all was OK.  Follow on Actions: The weight of the hat was checked and was found to be 14.9KG. The drops calculator was used to asses the potential of the event, under normal circumstances the hat would be held by the pulley system approximately 100mm to 200mm above the divers head whilst on a refreshment break. The absolute maximum height it could be held would be approximately 0.5M above the divers head, however, the COBRA hose lengths on the COBRA units used at the time would limit this significantly. The position of the hat is above the seated area in the bell, the only potential for the hat to drop on to he divers head would be in the seated position directly below the hat, under normal circumstances the hat is at or below shoulder height. Given the 14.9KG and an actual height of .1M the result would be slight however, the drops calculator is calculated with the wearing of ""standard PPE, eg hard hat, safety boots and eye protection, is assumed in the calculator"".  Diver 1 did not have head protection at the time of the event.  If the height was increased to half a meter the result would be for a minor: MINOR: A Medical Treatment Case (MTC). A Work-related injury that does not involve death, day(s) away from work, restricted work or job transfer, and where the employee receives medical treatment beyond first aid.  From the above the loss potential was entered as a possible MTC. Other factors to consider would be the fiction effect of the pulley/rope system on the hat as it descended.

15884,"TLS moon pool door ram with oil seepage at hydraulic fitting  Skandi Africa was in the JSE field at 004o 35.36’ N, 002o 54.23’ W at the Riser 5 safe over boarding zone location.  The construction crew were working on the TLS table above the moonpool installing bend stiffeners to the Riser 5 top dynamic section. During this period at approx.. 22:15 the smell of hydraulic oil was noticed by a crew member in the location and on looking down into the moonpool a small sheen of oil was observed in the water below.  The TLS team were immediately notified and started to look for a potential source of the oil sheen.  As operations were continuing with product through the moonpool the TLS team were unable to gain access to observe the table hydraulic system. When Riser Top 5 Dynamic section was connected to the A&R wire (with the hang off frame removed) the moon pool doors were opened to allow the team access to inspect the system.  In the background the management and supervisors had planned the inspection and prepared the necessary documentation to get a PTW issued for the task.  On inspection by the TLS team, they found a minor leak / seepage at the portside cylinder aft of no.6 ram of the moonpool table. Approx. 20 litres of hydraulic oil (Mobil Univi-46, SDS attached) was discharged from the hydraulic ram. It is estimated that less than a litre was observed actually in the seawater domain in the moonpool. The remaining oil was caught within the moonpool door structure.  Hydraulic Oil information:  Brand name: Univis N46 Manufacturer: Mobil/ExxonMobil Approx Quantity: 20 litres   Current situation/Initial actions taken?  Captain / OCM / Client informed. HSEA informed in the morning of 27th July. Fittings tightened and checked on port side in the area of the damage. Not possible during operations to access the full system. This will be completed during the next port call. Leakage at the ram railing contained and cleaned.  Investigation ongoing  Initial findings: Problem due to the hydraulic effect called “water hammering” it is a design problem. There has been previous issues observed on similar systems on other vessels. This was identified onboard by the CPE who raised a Modification Authorisation Form to change out the hydraulic directional valves “MAF SMO 009”. This was created and approved on 24/07/2022.

26476,"Deep Orient is currently demobilizing equipment from GK4 project in Malaysia.     On 12th February 2025, at approximately 02:40 , two technicians proceeded to lift the TR Winch 33 (Middle TR Winch) hub, to be able to engage the locking position pins, in order to secure it for lifting to the quayside.  During the operation, a miscommunication on the radio caused one operator to believe that all the pins were disengaged, and it was okay to commence jacking up the hub on the hydraulic rams. After a few seconds, a loud bang was heard by all on deck.   The Operator stopped operating the hydraulic rams. After a short investigation, it was discovered that one locking pin was still in the locked position preventing one of the rams from moving. The opposite ram had continued to lift causing the hub to lift and slightly rotate resulting in six bolts of the upper beam to shear and drop to deck. The plate that connects the structure to the upper beam is buckled and the hub has partially dislodged from its guide rail.    Current situation/Initial actions taken?  ?	All stopped on the job ?

My first trip I was having trouble getting the trailer backed in where we wanted it to go. After a couple tries I decided to drop the trailers on the Outlaw gap pad that is right next door instead; hoping to stay out of workovers way until we’re able to rig up tomorrow. On the road to get the next trailer I received a call saying two people witnessed me hit a J&A trailer with my trailer and leave. When I returned to check if I hit the trailer and speak to the safety man, I was ashamed to learn that I did. Jim showed me where there used to be a small box mounted on the side of the trailer that I scraped off with the back corner of my office shack. At this point we had a discussion about what could’ve been done differently and how to avoid any incidents in the future. Always double check your surroundings. Be positive there is ample room for the load behind, on the sides, as well as in front of the pickup. I certainly will not be putting my truck/trailer in reverse without a spotter anymore.

At 0330hrs the Huisman was connected with a 12Te Buoyance Module (BM) in preparation to deploy the ILT through the splash zone. The OCS commenced the pay-out on PR2 ILT with crane connected to the 12te BM, in Constant tension, conducting the deployment as per the project lay tables/lift plan. During the process, the static buoy and ILT were submerged, with the dynamic buoy still supported by crane. The crane was approx. 2-3m clear of splash zone. At this point the Pipelay system stopped due to failure of the Aft Reel Motor #1 Bridge rectifier. The vessel was brought to a stop. With the crane still connected, the load on the crane fluctuated as Constant tension struggled to maintain pace with the pitch and heave of the vessel with the maximum load quickly creeping up to the SWL of the crane. During this period, the SOCS and Crane op made the decision to knuckle in on the crane and reduce the radius by 2m, thus giving new SWL 52te with minor change in fleet angle. Unfortunately, before this process was complete, the load noted on the SCADA display peaked at 44.3te with SWL 43.3te at radius.  Reel Motor fault rectified – See actions below.

24799,"Brief account of the incident:  On November 9th, 2024, the AHTS Vessel Maersk Master was carrying out the pre-lay survey of the FPSO P-78 mooring lines.  At 10:33 am, it was noted that the hydraulic unit of the ROV was stopped. Both engines (port and starboard) stopped and the vehicle landed on the seabed without causing damage to itself or nearby assets. The ROV was recovered in a controlled manner to the cage (TMS) and then, at 12:00 pm, recovered to the vessel. It was noted the loss of 0.5L of Shell Tellus 32 hydraulic fluid, released to the sea. The protection device acted, causing the immediate shutdown of the HPU as expected, preventing the release of a greater amount of hydraulic fluid. The subcontractor's technical team initiated the first actions and reported a sheared bolt on the flange of the hydraulic starboard pump, which caused the flange seal (o-ring) to be ""ejected"", causing the leak.  Initial actions taken: - TechnipFMC and Client representatives on board the vessel have been notified. - Replacement of the pump and torqueing of the 4 screws and o-ring of the connection of the new port and starboard pumps. - Investigation started by Oceaneering..  Notes: - Shell Tellus 32 hydraulic fluid (classified as 97% hydraulic oil with 3% additives) – SDS/MSDS attached (no danger information, according to GHS, and as it is not a dangerous product it does not have a UN number). Low toxicity product with low environmental impact considering the damage study of its components and the amount leaked into the marine environment, according to the product's ecological information.

Ambos os motores (bombordo e boreste) pararam e o veículo pousou no leito marinho sem causar danos à si ou ativos próximos. O ROV foi recuperado de maneira controlada para a gaiola (TMS) e, às 12:00h pm, recuperado à embarca??o. Foi notada a perda de 0,5L de fluido hidráulico Shell Tellus 32, liberado ao mar. O dispositivo de prote??o atuou, causando o desligamento imediato da HPU conforme previsto, evitando libera??o de maior quantidade de fluido hidráulico. A equipe técnica do subcontratado iniciou as primeiras a??es e reportou um parafuso cisalhado no flange da bomba hidráulica de boreste, o que fez com que a veda??o do flange (o-ring) fosse “ejetada”, causando o vazamento.  A??es imediatas: - Representantes da TechnipFMC e Cliente a bordo da embarca??o foram notificados. - Substitui??o da bomba e torqueamento dos 4 parafusos e o-ring da conex?o da nova bomba de boreste. - Investiga??o iniciada pela Oceaneering.

27353,"While pressure testing an adapter, with a 10k bottom pressure and 5k top pressure, the team member installed a quick connect fitting and capped off the 5k pressure side.  This allowed no venting to the atmosphere.  This is normally left open to atmosphere to allow any risidual pressure to bleed off when pressure is dumped at the completion of the pressure test.  At the completion of the pressure test, all pressure was vented and the employee was allowed access to the test cell.  The employee attempted to remove the quick connect fiting, installed previously, but was unsuccesful.  The quick connect was unable to be removed which indicated pressure.  The employee exited the test cell and secured it.  After securing the test cell the employee notified local management.  The test cell remained secured until further action could be decided upon.  It was determined that during the pressurization of the 10k side, pressure leaked pasted the isolation plug until it fully seated, this resulted in pressure being trapped on the 5k side.
