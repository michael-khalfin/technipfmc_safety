ENTITY NAMES: UPPERCASE, MAX 4 WORDS (E.G., ""SAFETY INVESTIGATION"" NOT ""THE SAFETY INVESTIGATION""). NO FULL SENTENCES OR GENERIC TERMS LIKE 'WORKPLACE' AND 'AREA'.2. NORMALIZE SIMILAR ENTITIES WITH A CONSISTENT NAMING CONVENTION FOR ALL EQUIPMENT TYPES INVOLVED IN INCIDENTS: E.G., CONVERT TO THEIR CANONICAL NAMES (E.G., ""FORKLIFT"", ""FORKLIFT"" → ""FORKLIFT""). USE ONLY THESE RELATION TYPES, AND SKIP GENERIC TERMS AS BEFORE BUT ALSO INCLUDE RELATIONSHIPS LIKE 'POSSIBLE_CAUSE' FOR INFERRED RISKS NOT DIRECTLY STATED IN THE NARRATIVE:   - RELATION TYPES (ADDITIONAL): CAUSED_BY, POSSIBLE_CAUSE, RESULTED_IN, INVOLVED, OCCURRED_AT, AFFECTED, USED_IN. 3.

SEVERITY LEVELS ARE NOW INFERRED FROM THE NARRATIVE AND CATEGORIZED USING A PREDEFINED 5-LEVEL RISK MATRIX (E.G., NEGLIGIBLE - SEVERE).

THE NARRATIVE MAY INCLUDE IMPLICIT RISKS THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY STATED (E.G., POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE INCIDENTS, EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS). USE THE 'POSSIBLE_CAUSE' RELATION TYPE AND ASSIGN A SEVERITY LEVEL BASED ON YOUR RISK MATRIX ANALYSIS:   - IMPLICIT RISKS SHOULD BE INFERRED WITH ONLY ONE FULL SENTENCE IN DESCRIPTION USING NO MORE THAN 4 WORDS (E.G., ""THIS NARRATIVE SUGGESTS THAT DUE TO EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION, THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE INCIDENTS"" → 'POSSIBLE_CAUSE'"
