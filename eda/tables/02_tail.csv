The vessel is currently working on the Harbour Energy Talbot and Affleck Campaign inside the Affleck 500m zone. During standard operation ROV UHD 17 was in the process of being recovered to deck when a hydraulic hose (Gantry Snubber Damper Hose) failed during the lowering of the vehicle at the inboard position. The system was immediately shut down and onsite SOPEP kit used to prevent any potential spill into the sea, all relevant personnel were informed. The initial investigation identified that the hose failed as the gantry snubber damper was energised which is used to allow for the a more controlled movement of the vehicle in and out of the snubber. The damage hose was changed out and replaced before permission was granted to perform a system test. On completion of a successful test the vehicle was split to allow for further cleaning and degreasing, all the required scupper plugs were in place and a wet vacuum was used to collect the water residue post cleaning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Initial Findings.  1.The failed hose is located directly above the snubber and is energised to allow increased control when raising or lowering the vehicle from the snubber.  2.The team acted correctly and efficiently shutting down the system and utilising the SOPEP material located onsite.  3.The hose was covered in spiral wrap and is subject to visual inspection as per planned maintenance.  4.No impact of deformation was identified on the hose, other than burst at the mid part of the hose.  5.Approx 5 litres of Tellus 32 was lost into the ROV hanger.  6.No oil was lost overboard during the initial hose failure or clean-up operation.  7.The current reference document - Strategy for Management of Flexible Hose Assemblies (FHAs) MOS-QMT-47 calculates this release in the consequence table as (Class 3) (Medium) Moderate risk level may require additional control measures. Control measures should be reviewed, objectives and targets should be set if impact can be reduced.  8.The failed hydraulic hose is listed in the required hose register and within replacement date. (Date 01-2020).   Actions taken  The ROV recovery team initiated an immediate all stop and used the required SOPEP material efficiently to prevent any potential for an environmental spill. Permission was granted to access the damaged hose location to allow further investigation and repairs. On completion of repairs, hose replacement, the ROV  team conducted a  successful function test.","Stored energy (pressure, tension)",Construction - Installation-Construction,Not Applicable,True,True,10/20/2024,False,Completed,1.0,11/13/2024,11/13/2024,11/10/2024,TUK - UK - Aberdeen (UKBU),TFMC500,,,,,,55726.0

The Diver Supervisor on the panel could see that the Bellman was acting in an unusual manner and immediately called an all stop to the operation asking the Bellman to clip Diver 2’s hat back on so Diver 2 could get undressed and assist. The Dive Supervisor informed all key personnel immediately which included the Medic, OCM, Dive Tech Supervisor and HSEA who all arrived in Dive Control. Diver 2 removed his hat and proceeded to assist the Bellman by pouring cold water over his back and neck as the Bellman advised that he was feeling very hot. Diver 1 who was in the water was instructed to return to the bell to assist and prepare the bell for recovery back on to the system, during this period the Dive Supervisor provided regular feedback to the Medic regarding the Bellman’s state and condition which was noted as improving.

Test stand hydraulic pressure is controlled by applying pneumatic pressure to a diaphragm on the hydraulic regulators. The technician began adjusting the pneumatic regulators to increase hydraulic pressure. When the hydraulic pressure reached approximately 500PSI, a sound was heard similar to a regulator chattering and the air supply was immediately bled off to reduce hydraulic pressure. A noise was noticed that sounded like fluid or air flow and it was observed that a fluid mist was coming from a pressure fitting on the regulator control panel located in the rear of the test cell. The ESD was pressed for the test HPU, then verified no gauges showed pressure. The regulator panel hydraulic isolation valve was closed to isolate the HPU from the work cell. The 443 was cleaned up and disposed of properly. Technician was not exposed to the pressure release due to work cell design of the Test Stand hydraulic regulator control panel Initial observation appears that the fitting had possibly vibrated loose due to the regulator chatter and began to leak from the weep hole.","Stored energy (pressure, tension)",Vessel / Yards-Workshop Activities,Line of Fire - Keep yourself and others out of the line of fire,True,True,4/12/2022,False,Completed,1.0,,2/3/2023,2/14/2023,FFRANCE - France - Le Trait (Flexibles),TFMC611,,,,,,4858.0
