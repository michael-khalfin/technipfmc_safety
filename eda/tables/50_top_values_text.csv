"The Dodge Ram 2500 single wheel / short wheel base with steel flatbed was loaded and strapped down with a W-Industries HPU That was well over weight. The truck was leaning hard towards the back and to the driver side due to the overall weight and the placement of the accumulator bottles inside the HPU. We stopped the job and asked how much the HPU weighed. The driver of the truck stated that she was told it was 1000lbs. We knew this was incorrect so we asked the personnel that loaded the HPU and they stated that they do not have any paperwork for the HPU so they don't know. We explained to the hotshot driver that the HPU was much heavier than she was told and that it was not safe for her to travel wish this load. I reached up and pulled on part of the steel bed of the truck and the truck rocked back and forth well after I let go of the bed. The weight and CoG of this load in our opinion could have turned this truck over in a corner. I stepped away from the area and called HSE.  While awaiting HSE the truck was unloaded. The HSE personnel arrived on scene, but the truck had left by this point. We still do not know the weight of the HPU as it was weighed inside away from the area. There were also parts found on the HPU. Looks like a drops check was not performed either.",12
