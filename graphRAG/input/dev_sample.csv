Prior to lifting the eActuator Valve, the lead discussed the proper way to lift and strap it and assigned roles of the team that would be responsible for the task. One FST was designated as the lift operator, one FST was designated as spotter and signaler and a third FST designated in control of the tag line. The team began the rig up, lifted and secured the lower zipper valve as normal utilizing a JCB 12k telehandler. Moving next to the eActuator Valve, FSTs rigged and lifted as discussed with a 12ft blue strap utilizing a double basket (Front Bonnet To Rear Bonnet). This is rigged this way due to the extra weight from the adapter and motor on the front. Lifting with a four-point rig did not make up for shift in center of gravity for the load. Once rigging was in place the valve was then lifted with telehandler and positioned over the lower zipper to stab on. While lowering the eActuator Valve the bottom studs came into contact with the flange from the lower zipper causing a shift in weight. This made the valve hitch forward and become unbalanced and creating enough slack that the rear bonnet basket hitch came off causing the eActuator valve to fall forward to the ground (Approx. 6’3”/ 7500 lbs.).Once valve fell the lead tech stopped work to gather the information on what had happened and reported to management.",Equipment Suitability,Construction - Installation-Rig Up,Safe Mechanical Lifting - Plan lifting operations and control the area,True,True,Taylor Bownes (Taylor.Bownes@technipfmc.com),10/21/2024,False,Completed,3.0,1/22/2025,1/22/2025,11/25/2024,N/A - Non Project Specific,TFMC592,,,,NEAR_MISSES_translated,,,,,55827.0

Vessel heading 085°, Wind direction 106° East by South, Wave direction 115°T, max wave 3M, Hsig 2M.  Events leading up to the incident: Day shift rigging team had installed the cross haul rigging for the Prod 2 pipeline flex joint onto the JFL head clamp. After it was connected the head clamp was raised to it’s highest position so it could be secured in the tower.  There was no hold back rigging fitted therefore when the rigging was approximately half way up the tower the rigging was swinging due to ships movement. The rigging hit and did minor damage to a Stauff pipe clamp that was securing a hydraulic line and also slight damage to a Devol wear pad that is used for the transfer block wires at low tower angles less than 65 degrees    A equipe de rigging do turno diurno instalou o rigging de cross haul para a Flexible Joint de Prod 2 no head clamp da JFL (J-Lay Firing Line) da torre.

Description of incident:  At 1830hrs, vessel commenced the transfer of the 2nd end of section 2 of WE2B over the TLS to the reel. During this transfer the TLS un-squeezed the upper tensioner and retracted the frame. At 2100hrs TLS commenced the transfer of the 1st end of section 1 of WE2B from the carousel to the worktable. During this transfer, TLS commenced deployment and extension of the upper tensioner to engage on the WE2B. It was at this point when the portside TREM (Tensioner Retract Extend Mechanism) cylinder seal leak on the upper tensioner occurred at approx. 2120 hrs. It seem to occur only during movement of the cylinders, and not when it is at fully retracted/fully extended position.

In this case, a cordless wrench with an attached Unbraco pipe was used to hold the bolt. At the same time, one holds a piece of sandpaper with the other hand against the bolt and drives the nut driver at a slow speed, to remove some of the coating on the bolt's threads. What then happened was that nut spokes were most likely driven a little too fast and disposable gloves were used to hold sandpaper against the bolt. It was possibly squeezed a little too hard against the bolt with the hand holding the sandpaper. The right hand/thumb, which was wearing disposable gloves, grabbed the bolt and was pulled with something in the rotation when the nut cover was driven. The nail on the right thumb was torn up a little and a little blood was observed, indicating that the nail has loosened somewhat from the thumb itself. This was rinsed/cleaned with distilled water and a bandage was applied. The person felt a little dizzy. Was given water and told to sit with the legs slightly higher than the body and relax. Suggested measures: Do not use disposable gloves for such a job. Drive as slowly as possible with a battery nut driver. Do this manually. Brush by hand. Use e.g. Dremel etc. with a suitable polishing tool. Do not use disposable gloves when operating a nut driver, drill/screwdriver and similar rotating tools. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ For ? f? utbedret d?rlig cp p? en del av boltene p? en choke, s? sliper en av litt av belegget p? boltene for ? f? bedre kontakt.

Samtidig som en holder et pussepapir med den andre h?nden i mot bolten og kj?rer muttertrekker med sakte fart, for ? fjerne litt av belegget p? boltens gjenger. Det som da skjedde var at mutterekker ble kj?rt mest sannsynlig litt for fort og det ble brukt engangshansker for ? holde pussepapir i mot bolten. Det ble muligens klemt litt for hardt mot bolten med h?nden som holder pussepapir.

Inside the barriered area where the MEWP had started to operate there were 2 x TLS handrail modules that had been stowed out of the way of TLS operations. From midnight the MEWP was in use with 2 x ABs in the basket and the sub-contractor MEWP operator at deck level manoeuvring the equipment around the 150te crane boom.  Description of the incident: At 04:00 the ABs on the MEWP platform requested to come back down to deck. As the MEWP operator lowered the boom arm the first knuckle of the arm made contact with the top handrail of a TLS handrail module that was positioned inside the operating area.  The impact from the heavy steel knuckle / boom arm caused the handrail to bend downwards (See attached photoboard). Both ABs have stated that there was no shift  / movement in the basket during the contact. At this point it is estimated that the basket was approximately just below 2m. from the deck.  On realisation of the impact the MEWP operator raised the boom arm, swung out aft of the handrail modules and lowered the crew to deck. The deck crew reported the contact to the Pipelay team. The OMT and HSE Advisor were informed of the damage at the daily meeting at 08:00.  Initial actions taken: ?	Task suspended by HSE A.  ?	Inspection conducted of the handrail module and MEWP.  ?	Both handrail modules removed out of the operating area.  ?	Review of PTW and TRA for the task – additional information added to include that the site be free from all obstacles prior to work commencement.  ?	Barriers reviewed and re-routed.  ?	TOfS conducted with the relevant personnel involved in the work scope.",Difficult/Hindered operability of tools and equipment,Vessel / Yards-Marine Operations,Not Applicable,True,False,Skandi Africa HSE (africa.hse@technipfmc.com),11/5/2023,False,Completed,2.0,,11/16/2023,11/24/2023,TUK - UK - Aberdeen (TMOS),TFMC511,Skandi Africa HSE (africa.hse@technipfmc.com),Skandi Africa HSE,,ACCIDENTS_translated,,,,,

Retrieve Wachs saw for the 8” nozzle cut (N6) ? Nozzle N6 to be cut in two locations – secure before second cut (wt: 6.4mm, weight 33.3kg/m) ? Recover Wachs saw and cut section in the tooling basket ? Deploy 04-16” DWS on messenger ? Retrieve 04-16” DWS from messenger line (40kg in water) and manoeuvre into position for the N8 cut ? Secure DWS as required   On recovery to the deck of the Deep Discoverer it was noted that the stainless steel guide bar on the Wachs cutter was missing, the bar was 62 CM long and 25 MM thick with an approximate weight of 2.5 KG out of water (the weight in salt water would be 2.18 KG).  It is not known at what point the guide bar dropped, however, the known facts are that the guide bar dropped from below the divers working position, and the transfer path was well clear of subsea assets.   Incident Summary: The Wachs cutter had completed its cut and was intact and operational at that point, the Wachs cutter was recovered to the work station on the main deck using the messenger line (not the crane), it was upon recovery to the work station that the guide bar was noted as being missing.  Immediate action taken: Client and the platform have been informed. The ROV carried out a search for the missing guide bar but was unable to locate it. The Wachs cutter scope is complete and will no longer be required on this project, therefore there will be no impact on the project.  Initial findings: There was no potential for injury as the divers were positioned above the Wachs cutter during the transfer. This event was recorded as an environmental event due to the fact that a PON 2 was submitted by the Platform The vessel position and the position of subsea assets, the distance of travel between the worksite and vessel mini,ised the potential of this event.  NB: The density of stainless steel varies depending on the specific alloy, but it's typically around 7.7 to 8.0 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3). For this calculation, we took the average value of 7.85 g/cm3.  The buoyancy effect of seawater needs to be considered. Seawater has a density of around 1.025 g/cm3.  The weight of an object is equal to its mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2).  To calculate the weight of 2.5 kg of stainless steel in seawater  Step 1: Volume = 2.5 kg ÷ 8000 kg/m3 = 0.0003125 m3  Step 2: Weight of seawater displaced = 0.0003125 m3 × 1025 kg/m3 ≈ 0.3203125 kg  Step 3: Weight of stainless steel in seawater = 2.5 kg - 0.3203125 kg ≈ 2.1796875 kg  Therefore, the weight of 2.5 kg of stainless steel in seawater is approximately 2.18 kg.",Equipment condition,Vessel / Yards-Marine Operations,Not Applicable,True,True,Deep Discoverer HSE Advisor (deepdiscoverer.hseadvisor@technipfmc.com),7/25/2023,False,Completed,1.0,9/18/2023,9/18/2023,8/16/2023,TUK - UK - Aberdeen (UKBU),TFMC502,Deep Discoverer HSE Advisor (deepdiscoverer.hseadvisor@technipfmc.com),Deep Discoverer HSE Advisor,,ACCIDENTS_translated,,,,,

There was a requirement to provide a container to fill with methylated spirits to stow and clean the paint brushes being used for the task.  The Involved Person (IP) decided to utilise a used aluminium can for the job. A can was retrieved from the waste skip on the port side of the main deck. The aluminium can still had the lid partially attached.  The IP tried to remove the lid by pulling it away from the can with his hands. Due to the sharp edge of the lid the IP’s gloves were cut through. The lid caused a laceration to the inside of the middle finger, between the first and second knuckle on the IP’s left hand.  Initial action taken: The IP reported to the Medic for treatment. The Medic has cleaned the wound.  3 x sutures were applied to close the cut followed by a dressing.  The deck crew have been informed not to take any containers out of the bin or to use empty cans for containers.  A TOfS will be conducted to discuss the incident with the team and to prevent recurrence.  Initial findings: There were no suitable containers kept onboard for the task.

Forklift driver was removing an alu.box from rack (movable racks) and the box hit the spinkler that was installed on the beam. The sprinkler system was activated.  Friday, 25.10.2024, around 17:40, we triggered the alarm in B16.  The forklift driver was supposed to lift an aluminum box from location B16R30A when he accidentally hit the sprinkler. As he lifted, he raised the aluminum box high enough so it hit the support beam, with only 8 cm clearance before lifting. I was standing in a lift next to the location and saw the incident. The forks were lowered again, but not enough. The aluminum box was still in contact with the sprinkler. He started to reverse, and I shouted STOP. He didn’t react quickly enough, so he dragged the sprinkler with him. The sprinkler was then triggered, and water sprayed out with considerable pressure, setting off the alarm. None of us knew where to shut off the sprinkler system.  CCB portvakt was notified at 17:42. They received the alarm and arrived quickly. The portvakt didn’t know where to shut down the sprinkler system in the building. I called caretaker 1 at 17:46 for information about the sprinkler system, but there was no answer. I called caretaker 2 at 17:47 for information about the sprinkler system, but there was no answer.  HSE Manager was called at 17:57, to inform him about the situation and to see if he knew who could be contacted about the system. He informed me that Facility Lead could be contacted, but I didn't have the nr.  We tried to shut off the valve in B15 together with portvakt, but nothing stopped. At 17:55, we still had full water pressure in B16. The portvakt was told on the phone that we needed to go to the pump house to stop it, but we couldn’t figure out the system. He had several phone and radio conversations. CCB Portvakt and TFMC two operators  were in the pump house, writing on the valve and pressing the stop button, but the system kept restarting. Safety Representative B14 called at 18:07 to say that the main switch was in B14. We went in and stopped it. 1 TFMC operator remained in the pump house and turn off the system when it restarted. TMFC operator read in the pump house that you need to hold the system button for 8 seconds to turn it off. That stopped it. HSE Manager wanted me to call with information, referring to the message at 18:02. I called him at 18:10 and updated him. We still had full pressure in the sprinkler. He informed me that VP Subsea Services  would come to assist. He also said I should remember to take some pictures. We managed to turn off the system around 18:15. The Portvakt spoke with caretaker 2 and got information on how the system works. The entire sprinkler system in our buildings now needs to be drained of water. B9 came to help with a collector and pump so we could pump the water out. We collected water in steel/wooden tubs and transported it out in shifts. There was a great effort from everyone/B9 with cans and pumps to help. Incredible team effort. The entire system is now turned off, so we won’t have a working system if a fire breaks out in B14-B18. CCB confirmed to the gatekeeper that this could remain off until Monday. Senior mngt will check on responsibility and insurance. Director Onshore Services called at 19:31 to check on the situation. I informed him about the situation, and we waited for the water to subside. At 19:46, I sent a message to Senior Mngt that the water had stopped. 1 TFMC operator had been in B9 and got a stop screw and screwed it into the sprinkler. I contacted portvakten at 19:49 to inform him that it had stopped, we had taken in all the hoses, and we locked down the building. They will make regular inspections throughout the night. An incredibly unfortunate situation, a bit chaotic at the start because no one knew where the shut-off valve was. The CCB portvakt was unfamiliar with the system, and people tried things we didn’t know. Here, I said STOP and that  we wouldn't proceed until we got any more information.",,,Line of Fire - Keep yourself and others out of the line of fire,True,True,Johanne Mari Telle (JohanneMari.Telle@technipfmc.com),10/29/2024,False,Completed,2.0,1/13/2025,1/13/2025,12/30/2024,N/A - Non Project Specific,TFMC460,Johanne Mari Telle (JohanneMari.Telle@technipfmc.com),Johanne Mari Telle,Active,ACCIDENTS_translated,,,,,

The Skandi Vitoria was on DP, The sea was 1.4Hs, wind 5Kts S, visability was clear.Task / Actions Leading up to the Incident:At approx. 05:15 the aux line of the 250Te crane was recovered to deck from subsea with a subsea pennant and hook. Deck crew lowered the block to deck to enable the rigging to be back hooked to the block. In preparation for re-deployment subsea in approx. 30minutes.Incident / Initial Findings:The Rigging Supervisor instructed the crane operator to raise the boom and blocks to a safe height and could switch off for meal break.The crane operator then moved the crane to park on the boom rest, without any instruction or any deck crew observing the move. The crane operators main focus was on the main block as he knuckled in, ready to park on the boom rest. The crane operator didn’t realise the aux line raising in to the sheave. This resulted in the crane 110% alarm being activated. Time of Incident 05:30UPDATE 10.11.2021After investigation and received NOV data - the feedback from NOV after receiving the crane data, indicates that the AW wire was moving at approx. 37m/min at the time of impact and also that the hook stop was incorrectly set as the crane control system assumed there was another 1.4 mtrs to go. This cannot be attributed to the clash being due only to knuckling the boom. Extract from email from NOV Technical Advisor- A peak load of 30.8 ton on impact on the sheaves- Multiple movements was used at the time of impact. Main Boom Down, Knuckle Boom Inn and AW UP was is use at the time of impact - Speed of AW at the time of impact was approximately 37 m/m- We can see from the log that we have a wire pay out of 1.4m the time of impact. This indicates that the hook stop up, was set wrong or changed due to wire stretch. There is an alarm that reminds the operator to set the Hook stop Up if the hook has been submerged lower than 300 m.

Upon removal of the load test pipe from Tensioners, a number of the small individual rollers dropped into the barriered off area below.  The unaccounted for rollers were suspected to have fallen into water at stern of vessel. The bearing arrangement consists of 2 rows of 38 rollers. The team have accounted 71 in total thus far.  While docked in the port of Limassol, the  construction team were working under Routine Dutie’s: DE-RD-PLY-019 (Hot work inside the Tower Work Stations) and DE-RD-PLY-009 (Rigging work in Tower or Gantries routing wires), TRA’s DE-TRA-PLY 4504 ?(Pipe removal from the Tower) and DE-TRA-PLY 2004 ( Rigging Operation on pipelay tower and spooling gantry platforms as part of the straightening trials for Karish North Field Development iEPCI.

All going well, at 09:35hrs the commencing of the pay out on the pipe took place until the tail head was located inside the upper work station. The construction team then arranged the removal of the rigging.   At 0940hrs the closure and squeeze of the lower tensioner took place and simultaneously the removal of the rigging from the A&R. While the rigger was located under the upper work station roof (out of the line of fire) he leaned 	forward to take hold of the A&R rigging, it was at this point he felt something brush his left shoulder.

Upon completion of subsea preparation works, the recovery of ST-FX-6IN-9 was suspended due to forecasted increasing weather.  In anticipation of impending weather, additional tasks were identified that could be safely undertaken within operational limits. This included the cutting of jumper ST-FX-4IN-44, from H3 to H4 XT. Recovery of ST-FX-4IN-44 was discussed at the 0800am Offshore Leadership Team meeting (17th August 2024), Deep Orient morning meeting, HLDPR and shift plan.  At 19:23pm jumper ST-FX-4IN-44 was cut into approximately 5–5.5m sections in readiness for future recovery.  The following day, it was identified that jumper ST-FX-4IN-44 was not to be recovered until the Plug and Abandonment activities for associated XTs was performed. This was detailed in the Client Site Instruction (SI-011) issued on 9th April 2024.   Following confirmation that the line was not scheduled to be cut, the Deep Orient returned to Stybarrow field to perform visual inspection of the cut ends at H3 and H4 XT.   Initial findings at H4 identified small bubbles (est. 5mm) shedding every 10 seconds from what appear to be the annulus cavity between the flowline armour layer and outermost plastic sheathing. Deep Orient then relocated to H3 tree to the south and found there were nil visible leaks observed.   Note: As the discharge occurred before its intended time, the event has been recorded by TechnipFMC as a minor environmental release in alignment with the Global HSE Incident Classification Standard GPS-11-0017.    Immediate action taken: ?	Client and Onshore Perth team notified, ?	Vessel returned to Stybarrow field to performance visual inspection of the cut ends of H3 and H4 XT for leaks. ?

Medic administered pain relief and anti-inflammatory medication.  Findings  IP is due to disembark the day after the incident. IP reported that during his previous leave, he had experienced some pain in the same knee, but it had cleared up and he had experienced no discomfort during his offshore trip until now.  Medic has indicated that the left knee is inflamed.  Lathe is often used by authorised crew and IP indicated that he had spent 2 separate sessions of 20 minutes to carry out the task.  When using the lathe for screw cutting activities, it is common practice to utilise the brake system to stop the machine between cuts.  The lathe is mounted on a plinth as is commonly seen on vessels. This effectively raises the whole machine up.   Follow up actions  Medic to follow up with IP before disembarkation.

Actions leading up to and including the incident: The construction crew were using the portside TTS crane to load out rigging to be transferred to the North Sea Atlantic. On completion of the task a small leak was noticed coming from a hydraulic hose located on the TTS crane boom. At the time the boom was positioned at 35 degrees inwards to midships from the crane crutch. The leakage point at the hose located approximately 6m inside the deck on the portside.  The crane technician was immediately called to investigate and advise. The decision was made to return the crane boom to the crutch. As the crane was knuckled in a greater volume of oil escaped to the deck until the flow reduced to a drip when the boom was fully knuckled in. The boom was then slewed to port and returned to the crane crutch.    Immediate actions: SOPEP equipment was utilised to clean up oil spillages and placed under the crane boom. Bridge informed. Oil contained on the vessel and cleaned up. Estimated loss of hydraulic oil is approx. 5 x liters  Current findings: There was significant corrosion to the end fittings of the hydraulic hose. The crane has received 2 external inspections within the last 6 months which included the inspection of hydraulic hoses with no findings. The end fittings are protected with Denzo tape which prevents a visual inspection of the fitting unless removed and replaced.

An available technician from the pipelay team was dispatched to check the HPU tank which was confirmed low. Further Investigations ensued and it was established that there was a leak in the vicinity of flap 1 operating cylinder. The exact time the leak started is unknown but it is thought to have started at some point in the last two weeks. It is estimated that approximately 45/50 litres of Shell Tellus 46 has been lost through the moonpool to sea during this time.  Initial Actions: ?	Operations stopped on flap one  ?	SOCS,CPE, Client, Bridge, Project Operations Manager and HSEA made aware   ?	PTW 3224 raised to access and install isolation valves onto the pressure and return lines.  ?	Investigation into the exact source of the leak.  Follow on Actions: Isolation vales installed  onto the pressure and return lines Risk assessment reviewed and updated to deploy product without  the use of flap one  Initial findings: The wiper seal on the cylinder rod is thought to have  failed due to fair wear and tear (approx. 10 years of use). There is a void space below the cylinder which has captured some of the oil estimated between 5/10 litres. No oil has been observed in the moonpool during 1st and second end umbilical deployment's. Cause – Failed hydraulic cylinder rod seal on Flap #1 of the Work Table, likely the failure due to age, similar incident previously on Flap #3.  One spare cylinder held shared between CDA and DST, removed unit from Flap #3 sent onshore for repair Dec 22 and haven’t received back onboard yet, due date end of June 23. Recommendations – Intention to replace the cylinder with a overhauled unit during the July maintenance period and send the removed cylinder for overhaul. Timeline – Unable to determine exactly when the leak started, the cylinder is not visible and cannot be inspected, the underside of the Work Table is inaccessible, approximation of no more than 14 days based on main HPU oil tank levels.  Indication of the leak was noted when a low level alarm indicated on the PLS SCADA system.   Resumo do incidente: Durante as opera??es de lan?amento de tubula??o para implantar UEH 9f umbilical de inje??o 5, o operador do pipelay situado na cabine de controle de instala??o de tubula??o notou que o alarme de nível baixo foi ativado na unidade de energia hidráulica (HPU) principal. Um técnico disponível da equipe de pipelay foi enviado para verificar o tanque da HPU, que foi confirmado como baixo. Investiga??es adicionais se seguiram e foi estabelecido que havia um vazamento nas proximidades do cilindro operacional da aba 1. A hora exata em que o vazamento come?ou é desconhecida, mas acredita-se que tenha come?ado em algum momento nas últimas duas semanas. Estima-se que aproximadamente 45/50 litros de Shell Tellus 46 foram perdidos através do moonpool para o mar durante este tempo.  Acoes iniciais:  ?   Opera??es iterrompidas no Flap #1  ?   SOCS, CPE, Cliente, Gerente de Opera??es do Projeto e HSEA avisados. ?   Permiss?o de trabalho 3224 emitida para o acesso e isolamento das válvulas das linhas de press?o e retorno.  ?   Investiga??o em  para identificar a fonte do vazamento.  Descobertas iniciais: Acredita-se que a veda??o do limpador na haste do cilindro tenha falhado devido ao desgaste normal (aprox. 10 anos de uso).

One of the PLS technicians was tasked with conducting routine maintenance at the top of the PLS tower  Summary of finding: At approximately 11.00am during maintenance duties on top of the PLS top sheeve forward drive system. The PLS technician noticed that the drive wheel had broken up and was now situated in the containment tray approximately 900mm below. The wheel had broken up into 5 separate pieces. The wheel is made up of 4 separate sections, all sections were accounted for with one section breaking into two pieces culminating into the 5 pieces recovered from the containment tray. Initial action taken: ?	All pieces secured in a plastic bag and taken down to deck. ?	Area checked for other potential dropped objects and confirmed all pieces of the drive wheel were accounted for. ?	CPE Informed. ?	OCM, Client, Project and HSEA made aware.  ?	Investigation Initiated.  Initial findings: Still unclear why the damage occurred but it is thought it happened during or after completing the transfer of the 1st end top riser. Various measurements have been taken to assess the potential for any of the pieces to fall to deck. The containment tray in place below the drive wheel successfully collected all pieces from the drive wheel as is its purpose. There are gaps situated around the containment tray which should be covered to prevent any objects in the future  dropping through to the deck below. During assessment for potential dropped objects object 5 was the only piece deemed with any potential to drop through one of the gaps. The largest gap along one side of the containment tray is 90mm with the dimensions of piece 5 at 230mm long – 88m wide on one side and 75mm on the other and around 60mm thick.  The containment tray has a 80mm edge around the perimeter. After analysis it was concluded that, although piece 5 theoretically would fit through the gap in certain orientations, the likelihood of this happening was extremely remote as the object would have to land in an exact orientation, without contacting any surface to be able to pass through the gap.

In preparation of the 8inch PLA08 flowline subsea installation, ROV (UHD 23) made accidental contact with a hydraulic control line (HW443) while making a planned grab for the ROV handle on the PLA manifold on Hydraulic Flow Line (HFL) at MCQ4 hub.  The ROV initial intended to grab the horizontal bar on the north face of the Pluto manifold however, there was not a suitable position to achieve good line of site with both cameras and therefore had to opt for the vertical grab handle on the northeast corner. ROV handles on this manifold are clearly identified with being painted Orange in colour. In the process of grabbing the handle, the ROV five function manipulator (Rigmaster) has made contact with a hydraulic control line which, is exposed by design, to the south of the handle.   As a consequence of the contact, the control line has had a loss of containment and internal fluid has been released to the environment.  The fluid released to environment was a subsea production control fluid (Oceanic HW443 – ethylene glycol, antifreeze).  and the volume was estimated to be up to 2m3",Unprotected/unguarded moving machine parts (struck by/caught by),Construction - Installation-Construction,Not Applicable,True,True,Deep Orient HSE (deeporient.hse@technipfmc.com),9/21/2024,False,Completed,3.0,,11/19/2024,11/30/2024,TPOCEANIA - Australia - Perth,TFMC505,Deep Orient HSE (deeporient.hse@technipfmc.com),Deep Orient HSE,,ACCIDENTS_translated,,,,,

Skandi Africa was currently in the recovery process of the Riser 10 flowline.   Gas checks and NORM checks were completed as per procedure before the removal of each anode.   It was noted that some weeping of oil were noted at the outer sheath holes after the removal of the anodes.   Description of incident:  IP is responsible for the installation of TRACON/Repair clamps. Repair clamps are fitted around the flexible outer sheath and are used to seal off the outer sheath vent holes  He installed 3 x repair clamps on the 2nd end of Riser 10 flowline.   IP was wearing the required eye protection (safety glasses) during the installation.   But as there is air and wave movement at the moonpool, it creates wind that escapes via the moonpool door opening where the flowline is in place.   He alleges that this “breath of air” could have caused some of the discharges (not clear on what exactly is the cause - oily water discharges, crude oil discharge, water from the moonpool) enter his eye bypassing or bouncing off his safety glasses  At that time, he did not feel any irritation and continued working until the completion of the 3 x clamps.    On the 24th of October around 0645 hrs, IP came to see the Doctor/ medic onboard complaining of irritation and swelling of the left upper eyelid.

MPS ROV was at a depth of 1967 Meters connected to the buoyancy rigging to disconnect the buoyancy from the TRF. Whilst trying to untangle the rigging there was excessive strain on the 5 Function manipulator due to vessel heave and the Buoyancy uplift. This resulted with the mechanical sheer pin on the manipulator sheering and causing damage to the hose. This incident caused an oil loss of 2.6 litres.

Task leading up to the Incident: The IP was assisting his supervisor carryout Inspection of a class 4 torque tool which was situated on the floor of the ROV workshop.   Incident Summary: Following Inspection the two ROV team members decided to lift the torque tool weighing 30kg and position it on the workbench Immediately next to the tool position. During the final moments of the lift while placing the tool onto the bench the IP felt a sharp pain in his back.   Initial action taken: The IP Stated he felt discomfort in his back following the manual handling activity but not enough to warrant seeking the medic. (see witness testimony in documents). 3 hours later following his meal the IP felt his condition was deteriorating so he decided to attend the vessel medic. The medic examined the IP and issued some over the counter pain killers in the form of Paracetamol to help alleviate any pain. The Deep Star captain, OCM and HSE Technician were all informed.    Initial findings: IP stated correct manual handling techniques were adopted while carrying out the task and the lift was performed by two personnel. The day before the IP had felt some discomfort in his back but thought this was due to normal muscle pain from a previous gym workout the day before  (see witness testimony in documents). IP also attended the medic on the 17th of April with a concern about numbness in his left hand, he was advised by the medic that if it got worse or he was in pain to immediately come back and see him. IP stated on the morning of the 18th he felt fine with no pain or concerns about his back or left hand. Approximately 3 hours into his shift on the 18th the IP felt a sharp pain in his back following a routine manual handling task.   Condi??es ambientais: A Deep Star está atualmente no Brasil realizando o projeto Mero1F2+ situado no campo Mero 1.  Tarefa que antecedeu o Incidente: O colaborador  estava ajudando seu supervisor a realizar a inspe??o de uma ferramenta de torque classe 4 que estava situada no piso da oficina do ROV.  Resumo do incidente: Após a inspe??o, os dois membros da equipe do ROV decidiram levantar a ferramenta de torque pesando 30 kg e posicioná-la na bancada imediatamente ao lado da posi??o da ferramenta. Durante os momentos finais do levantamento, ao colocar a ferramenta na bancada, o colaborador  sentiu uma dor aguda nas costas.  A??o inicial tomada: O colaborador  informou  que sentiu desconforto nas costas após a atividade de manuseio manual, mas n?o o suficiente para justificar a procura do médico. (ver depoimentos de testemunhas nos documentos). 3 horas depois de sua refei??o, o colaborador  sentiu que sua condi??o estava piorando, ent?o ele decidiu comparecer ao médico do navio. O médico examinou o colaborador  e prescreveu alguns analgésicos  e  de paracetamol para ajudar a aliviar qualquer dor. O capit?o do Deep Star, o OCM e o técnico de HSE foram todos informados.  Descobertas iniciais: O colaborador  informou  que técnicas corretas de manuseio manual foram adotadas durante a execu??o da tarefa e o i?amento foi realizado por duas pessoas. No dia anterior, o IP sentiu algum desconforto nas costas, mas pensou que isso se devia a uma dor muscular normal de um treino de academia  no dia anterior (ver depoimento de testemunha nos documentos). Colaborador também foi no médico no dia 17 de abril com uma preocupa??o sobre dormência na m?o esquerda, ele foi avisado pelo médico que se piorasse ou ele estivesse com dor para voltar imediatamente para vê-lo. O colaborador  afirmou na manh? do dia 18 que se sentia bem, sem dores ou preocupa??es nas costas ou na m?o esquerda.

After the salt sack was lifted, the IP moved to the starboard side aft to ensure the landing area was clear. The IP was in the process of guiding the load down with the tag line when the tag line came loose from the hook. The IP stumbled back and hit a fire hose case positioned on a handrail. The IP notified the rigging supervisor of the injury via radio. The rigging supervisor did not have visibility of the incident as he was located on the port side behind the compressor spread to ensure personnel were clear during the lift. The rigging supervisor had not made it to the landing area when the incident occurred but had given permission for the rigger to land the load. Immediate Actions Taken:- The IP was placed on a stretcher and taken to the gangway.- The medic monitored the IP while the ambulance arrived.- The IP was transferred to the quayside using a medical stretcher lifting basket and placed in the ambulance.- All stop called to allow a TOFS to be held and initial investigation to be conducted.- A deck hazard hunt was performed to identify and clear any trip hazards.Additional Information:- The tag line was attached to control the pennant when attaching and disconnecting the crane. - These are typically short taglines and it is also used for smaller loads. - There is always a tagline on the pennant.- The tag line did not break/part but came undone.- These tag lines are not checked regularly. - Radios were being used for communication between the work party and the crane operator.

On 2 November 2024, the Olympic Triton, engaged in the Statfjord A Decommissioning Project, was operating within the 500m zone of Statfjord A to conduct a debris survey of the spool route. ?	At approximately 1724 the WROV C07 was returning to deck due to increase in weather, As the WROV was just inside the hanger there was a leak with the valve pack causing hydraulic fluid to be discharged into the WROV drip tray, at no time was any oil discharged elsewhere. ?	The WROV managed to be landed safely and secured before the team began fault finding the issue and cause. ?	It was discovered that the leak of hydraulic oil had come from a dislodged ‘O’ ring and a bent valve backing plate. The plate was straightened and the ‘O’ ring reinstalled. The system was pressure tested OK and the cause of the leak further investigated.  ?	Investigation revealed LARS System lost between 40-50 liters of hydraulic oil. ?	After further investigation it was found that the isolation valve that is mounted on the return line of the hydraulic system was closed during the recovery of the ROV when it should have been open during launch and recovery operations. The valve is equipped with a microswitch to lock the start button and prevent the HPU from starting when closed, a test on this valve showed that the microswitch was sticking indicating that the valve is in an Open position and this enabled the HPU to be started when the valve was closed, leading to an increase in pressure on the valve pack dislodging the ‘O’ ring and causing the leak. ?

The previous 48 hours the vessel had been conducting interim mobilisation activities at Kakinada Port.     Environmental Conditions: On Saturday 14 May 2022 the temperature at the port was recorded as high as 34 degrees Celsius, with high humidity levels of 70%+ and no wind.  Events leading up to the incident:The Involved Person (IP) is a member of the construction deck crew and is on the AM (Midnight to midday) shift.The IP had joined the vessel 2 days previously at the anchorage on the 12th May 2022. The IP is employed as a Deck Coordinator. Upon arrival the IP was additionally tasked with the Assistant Rigging Supervisor (ARGS) functions as the 2 x Deck Supervisor had been sent ashore for medical treatment. The IP was functioning as the main supervisor for the Riggers for the first 6 hours of the shift until the designated ARGS arrived on shift at 06:00.During shift on Saturday 14th May the IP had felt uncomfortable with the heat and had experienced body cramps whilst on deck. The body cramps continued during the rest period which interrupted the IP's sleep.The IP went on shift at midnight on the 14/15 May 2022. At approximately 08:30 on15/05/2022 the IP was observed by the Chief Pipelay Engineer walking around the deck looking unwell. When the IP was questioned on how he was feeling he gave a confused answer which alerted the CPE to a potential health issue. The CPE called over the ARGS and the IP was escorted into the accommodation. Whist the IP was in the changing room he was observed vomiting into the sink and complained of body cramps. The Bridge was immediately informed who then contacted the vessel master. The vessel master deployed to the changing room and assessed the IP. Following a review of the IP’s symptoms and general signs it was identified that the IP was suffering from a heat related illness/injury.  Immediate actions: ?	IP recovered to the hospital given fluids and kept cool ?	09:05 Medevac procedure initiated – CSR informed. ?	10:46 Helicopter on deck. ?	10:56 Helicopter off deck with IP onboard.  ?	IP has been received by the onshore medical facility. Onshore project logistics responding.  Initial findings:  ?	Crew member had been onboard for 2 and 1/2 days. ?	Conditions on the Heat Stress Index were noted as high for the previous 48 hours. ?	Hot conditions the previous day had been identified by the HSE A with a strong focus for the PM shift on heat stress during the shift handover briefing ?	A number of other crew members have stated that they had found the temperatures excessive and had experienced minor heat stress symptoms during the 48 hours alongside. ?	There was no Deck Supervisor on shift. ?	ARGS joined the shift at 06:00 ?	The shift was/is under-manned. ?

Wind was 8 knots from the west.   Events leading up to the incident: The rigging team were embarking 14 inch rigid pipe.  The team had just located the spooling elbow into the stbd reel and the 80mm end cap had been fitted. The reel was then rotated in order to bring the pipe onto the vessel.  Incident: At approx. 13.00 hrs it was reported there was damage to the access step on the stbd reel elbow end securing . The step is approx. 150mm wide and 1000mm long  and is connected to number 1 crane pedestal.  It hinges on 2 brackets and is stored in an upright position when spooling.  An 80mm endcap for the pipe elbow had been fitted and appears that this had caught the platform when rotating the reel  Immediate actions taken: All stop was called and the damaged platform removed.  Spooling was stopped for approximately 15 minutes to remove the platform and inspect the end cap for damage  Notes: There was no damage to the end cap although there are some scraping marks.  There was no potential harm to personnel or the environment.  If the step had come off of the crane pedestal it would have fallen to the reel well which is a no go area. (Hard barriered off with signage.) As we were embarking 14 inch rigid pipe a bigger elbow is fitted to the pipe and therefore an 80mm end cap was needed.  It is thought that It is the first time an 80mm end cap has been used since the step had been replaced. The step is used for access to fit the stbd reel end cap The design of the step for the port reel differs from the stbd.

Part of this task included the fitting and torquing of a greyloc connector to the flexible. A pre-installed engineered working platform had been setup to allow safe access to the table providing a stable working platform for teams to operate around the product. To complete the greyloc connection the team were using an impact wrench to set the connector in place before applying the torque tool for the 3 passes necessary up to the approved torque setting as per procedure. The crew member was one of the VLS team who was operating the impact wrench to set the connector when he felt a pain, discomfort in his right elbow.

Offloading and storage stacking began on the 20th of December and concluded on the 23rd of December 2023. Vallourec supervised the stacking operations which were executed by the Port Authority workers (Login TVV) in accordance with the Vallourec Operating Procedure which stated that the pipe was to be stacked 9 layers high to a height of circa 2.5 meters.   At 1500 hours on the 28th of December 2023, the Vallourec transport provider ‘Login TVV’ (Port Authority) identified via CCTV footage that the first storage stack area had collapsed, and various joints of line pipe had rolled across the hard standing. The Port Authority subsequently notified Vallourec and confirmed that the incident had occurred. No personnel were nearby at the time of the occurrence and as such no injury to personnel occurred. However, there were no mitigations (hard barriers) placed in the area by the Port Authority to protect personnel from harm should they have had cause to be in the vicinity at the time of the stack collapse.  TechnipFMC had raised concerns with Vallourec regarding the stack height but were assured that this was compliant with Brazilian guidance.  No further action was taken.  Vallourec confirmed 9 layers was normal procedure and followed the guidelines of ABNT NBR 16212:2013 Standard – Pipes Storage in Discovered Area. Engineering calculations provided by Vallourec also showed that the stack was within the safe working capacity. Vallourec confirmed the stacking arrangement had been utilised on many projects without incident for temporary storage. Vallourec also confirmed that the stack height would be acceptable and that working at height arrangements would be put in place to mitigate the risk. Vallourec also detailed that due to the storage arrangements being temporary, end posts could not be utilised, and metallic end stops would have to be used.   This was accepted by both Shell and TFMC. Delivery of the pipe to the port began on the 20th of December and was concluded on the 23rd of December without issue.  **  TFMC have circulated a Duty of Care / One Pager docuement outlining the incident and the lessons learned to all Projects.

The most likely scenario would have been personnel-injury due to someone receiving a strike from a moving untethered pressurized hose. The likelihood of this scenario is extremely low due to the needed position and lack of awareness from the potential injured person. The severity of the injury is difficult to assess.

The vessel passed us within 50 metres at a speed of 9 knots causing a bow wave that unfortunately buffeted the Skandi Africa, causing the vessel to pull away from the quayside.  This imposed force put excessive strain on the forward springs.  The spring was doubled up and at 13:11 one of the lines failed at the fairlead onboard and separated with a loud banging noise and appeared to recoil in the direction of the quayside. Approximately ten seconds later the second spring failed at the fairlead and again appeared to recoil in the direction of the quayside. The vessel now started to drift on the headline and the bow started to move away from the jetty.  The vessel has a forward and midships gangway configuration, at this point the gangways started to move on their rollers located on the quayside. The bridge engaged thrusters to counter the vessel moving way away from the jetty and bring it back alongside.  The gangway rollers now started to move back to there original position. A pallet with items was butted up to the end of the midships gangway at the quayside end. It appears that the momentum of the vessel coming back alongside has caused the rollers to stop moving as they have made contact with the pallet, and load has been applied at the weakest point of the gangway which is the hooks that attach over the ships side, causing one of the aluminium hooks to fail and in effect making the entire gangway unserviceable.",Uncontrolled moving objects/ parts (struck by other than machine parts and dropped objects),Vessel / Yards-Load-Out,Line of Fire - Keep yourself and others out of the line of fire,True,False,Skandi Africa HSE (africa.hse@technipfmc.com),8/29/2024,False,Completed,4.0,11/1/2024,11/1/2024,10/31/2024,LTP - Portugal - Lisbon,TFMC511,Joao Paulo Andrade (joaopaulo.andrade@technipfmc.com),Joao Paulo Andrade,Active,ACCIDENTS_translated,,,,,

Working depth was between 34-39 metres.   Dive team 1 had recently completed the milling of bumper pad casting No22 and recovered the milling machine to deck and had just completed the ACFM (alternating current field measurement) inspection of casting No22. The next step of the operation was to de-rig the work site and recover the subsea work platform and tooling to deck.  Incident / Initial Findings:. In preparation for the recovery of the work platform, the ROV had been requested by the Dive Supervisor to carry out a visual inspection of the sky hook the rigging and lift bag. At approximately 13:20hrs the Dive Supervisor instructed the Divers to connect the work station to the pre-installed sky hook and rigging in preparation for recovery. 13:28hrs the crane was lowered to depth, monitored by XLX 126. Once the work station was connected to the sky hook rigging, a request was made to the Dvr’s to come up on the chain hoist and take the weight of the work platform on to the sky hook and rigging. This transferred the weight of the work platform from the four Dyneema chains suspended from the trunnions to the sky hook and rigging allowing the Dyneema chains to be disconnected. The outer most left hand chain was disconnected first followed by the outer most right hand chain, the inner left hand chain was next to be disconnected. As Diver two released the fourth Dyneema chain in sequence from the inner right hand trunnion at 13:30hrs he reported that the work platform and sky hook were dropping. The Dive Supervisor immediately told both Dvr’s to “let it go and let the strops take the weight”. The work platform descended approximately 6 metres and came to stop on the pre-installed sky hook hold back rigging.  Dive Supervisor checked that both Dvr’s were all clear and ok and that everything was secure. As the crane was already at depth at 13:32hrs Dvr 2 was instructed to connect the crane to the work platform. 13:34hrs the crane was connected in preparation for the recovery to deck of the work platform. 13:48hrs the work platform was recovered to deck.  Current Situation/ Initial Actions taken:. OCM, HSE, Captain and Clients informed. Investigation initiated.  Actions: TOFS completed with all four Dive Teams with their respective Supervisors.  Subsequent Actions: During Dive 55 Dive Team 1 Supervisor requested that an inspection of the Sky hook and rigging be completed by the divers - X5 Champagne leaks identified in the lift bag - Lift bag swapped out.  Comment 1: The sky hook and associated rigging were installed by Team 1 on Dive 43 on the 28.06.24 at approximately 12:20hrs.

As part of the maintenance, MAUA personnel were carrying out needle gunning activities in engine room 1 supply vent on deck 1. At approximately 14:30, while performing this activity, one of the MAUA workers felt what he has described as a mild static-like electric shock on his right forearm. At this point, the individual disconnected his equipment, thinking it might be faulty, stopped work, and called the MAUA electrician. The MAUA electrician attended and inspected the equipment, finding no faults. On further investigation, it was noted that a cable from one of the actuator boxes for controlling the dampers in the area where the individual was needle gunning was damaged.

Incident / Initial Findings: During these operations a bilge alarm in the pump room was observed on the panel in the ECR. The ECR team immediately turned on the bilge pump for the area and went to investigate. The investigation identified that there was water ingress into the bilge area from the inlet side of Seawater pump number 2 and the Chief Engineer was called.  Immediate Actions taken: The request was then made for the ROVs to recover to deck to allow reconfiguration of the system i.e. common the board in order to isolate the Portside Sea Water system. This would result in the loss of DP class 3 status, during the recovery the water ingress was being monitored and was assessed as approximately 1m3 per hour.  The ROV were on deck and the vessel secured for transit at 23:20hrs and transit to Kakinada port commenced at 23:59. The vessel arrived alongside at 09:17hrs on the 17th of January and the Marine Engineers commenced an assessment of the equipment.

Wind: 090° x 9 Knots ?             Wave 3 / 4.8 metres ?            Current: 310° / 2 Knot  Task Leading up to the Incident:  At the time of the Incident the ROV directed by the OCS were tasked with connecting two X RUD hooks to x 2 buoyancy modules one hook per buoy before cutting the  Polly prop rope to release the buoys from their anchor position onto the crane rigging for recovery.  Description/summary of Incident:  During the buoy recovery operations the hooks were connected to both buoys and after checking that the hooks were correctly installed to the rigging, the poly-prop cuts were made to release the  first buoy from its anchors.  While waiting for visibility to check the cut/setup for the next buoy, the Bridge reported that a buoy was spotted on the water surface at 18:08 hours.   Initial Action taken: ?	Bridge reported that the Buoy was seen at the surface  ?	The ROV video was checked and it was clearly observed that the buoy was no longer connected to the hook ?	OCM, HSE Tech and Client Informed ?	Maritime observation form issued to alert other vessels in the area ?	HSE Tech Initiated an Investigation  Initial findings: On review of the ROV footage both hooks look to be connected with no obstructions or anomalies. Further footage shows just before the final cut that the RUD hook is connected but is also lying on its side with potentially one side of the release catch depressed. This is because the order in which the ropes were cut (1 and 2 first) meant that the Buoy flipped almost 90 degrees as it was still secured by one rope (rope 3).  The position of the crane in relation meant the rigging became caught below a master link resulting in the resting position of the hook being on the top corner of the Buoy. (see story board) Video footage also shows the ROV adjusting its position while holding the RUD hook. During this footage one side is depressed first but both latches make a movement. Only two RUD hook have been available since the start of project and no maintenance or equipment function checks are known to be routinely carried out. This was a recovery operation of client Buoyancy the two buoys are separated and recovered with only one hook per Buoy . TFMC Buoyancy is joined together meaning there is a secondary hook used for recovery.   - Hook B certification expired on 17/09/2022 Hook E expires on 08/12/22. On recovery both RUD hooks were Inspected and found to be defective. Partial opening occurs when one latch is depressed this is evident on both hooks. Report to be added to case  Condi??es ambientais: ? Vento: 090° x 9 Nós ? Onda 3 / 4,8 metros ? Corrente: 310° / 2 nós  Tarefa que levou ao incidente: No momento do incidente, o ROV dirigido pelo OCS foi encarregado de conectar dois ganchos X RUD a x 2 módulos de flutua??o, um gancho por bóia, antes de cortar o cabo de sustenta??o Polly para liberar as bóias de sua posi??o de ancoragem no equipamento do guindaste para recupera??o.  Descri??o/resumo do Incidente: Durante as opera??es de recupera??o das bóias os ganchos foram ligados a ambas as bóias e após verifica??o da correta instala??o dos ganchos no cordame, foram feitos os cortes do polyprop para libertar a primeira bóia das suas ancoras. Enquanto aguardava visibilidade para verificar o corte/configura??o da próxima bóia, a Ponte informou que uma bóia foi avistada na superfície da água às 18:08 horas.  A??o inicial tomada: ? A Ponte informou que a Bóia foi vista na superfície ? O vídeo do ROV foi verificado e foi claramente observado que a bóia n?o estava mais conectada ao gancho ? OCM, o HSE e Cliente Informado ? Formulário de observa??o marítima emitido para alertar outras embarca??es na área ? O HSE iniciou uma investiga??o  Achados iniciais: Na revis?o da filmagem do ROV, ambos os ganchos parecem estar conectados sem obstru??es ou anomalias. Mais imagens mostram pouco antes do corte final que o gancho RUD está conectado, mas também está deitado de lado com potencialmente um lado da trava de libera??o pressionado. Isso ocorre porque a ordem em que as cordas foram cortadas (1 e 2 primeiro) significava que a Bóia virou quase 90 graus, pois ainda estava presa por uma corda (corda 3). A posi??o do guindaste em rela??o significava que o cordame ficou preso abaixo de um elo mestre, resultando na posi??o de repouso do gancho no canto superior da bóia. (veja o storyboard) As imagens de vídeo também mostram o ROV ajustando sua posi??o enquanto segura o gancho RUD. Durante esta filmagem, um lado é pressionado primeiro, mas ambas as travas fazem um movimento. Apenas dois ganchos RUD est?o disponíveis desde o início do projeto e nenhuma manuten??o ou verifica??es de funcionamento do equipamento s?o realizadas rotineiramente. - A certifica??o Hook B expirou em 17/09/2022 e o Hook E ira expira em 08/12/22.Na recupera??o, ambos os ganchos RUD foram inspecionados e considerados defeituosos. A abertura parcial ocorre quando uma trava é pressionada, isso é evidente em ambos os ganchos.

At the time and date stated, the IP was on board an Osprey Vessel (Eemslift Ellen) in Spain, during which time the IP fell 4m from a ladder. The IP slipped on a wet rung as it had been raining heavily. The IP was alone and there were no witnesses to the actual fall. Colleagues had heard a loud noise, called out to the IP to ask if he was okay and he responded yes. Using the same ladder, the IP climbed from the cargo hold where he rejoined his colleagues on the tween deck who noticed the IP in pain. As a result of the fall, the IP was taken to hospital (San Agustin - Aviles) where following examination, it was confirmed that he has sustained a fractured pelvis. Medical professionals that assessed the IP believed in Aviles, that the injury should heal without the need for any invasive medical procedures/operations, however, on the transferring to hospital in Cyprus a second opinion believes that an operation would be the best course of action to heal faster and more effectively. The IP underwent surgery on 9th March, all went well and the IP is in a stable condition. The recovery time is 6-8 weeks.    The ladder was temporarily fixed to the vessel structure with ratchet straps and had no vertical cage (backscratcher) and working at height equipment/100% tie-off was not employed. The ladder was put on the vessel 3/4 days prior (17th February 2023) to the IP falling at an initial mobilisation at Invergordon, Scotland. Following mobilisation of equipment at Invergordon, it was identified that the three main access / egress to the cargo hold were all blocked and could not be used.  A ladder was thereafter put in place by the vessel crew, which was secured using ratchet straps.  The ladder was circa 5m in height. The load plan for this mobilisation was produced by Osprey and signed off by TFMC project team. No access restrictions were identified during the review of the load plan.

Whilst conducting visual checks of the crane , the Crane Technician observed a broken bolt attached to the rope guard on the auxiliary winch tip sheaves of the NOV Crane. After investigation, fresh impact damage to the VLS gutter deflector was also observed. There is yellow paint, consistent of the gutter deflector scuffed on to the knuckle of the crane. This would indicate that there has been contact between the crane and the VLS gutter deflector.   The knuckle section of the NOV crane was lowered to the main deck and inspected. It was found that the bolt from the aux wire guard had sheared off and was hanging from the bolt hole in the guard. The nut and tail portion of the bolt have been sheared off and not recovered.  After the inspection, the broken bolt was replaced, and crane returned to service. A sweep of the deck and the VLS has taken place to locate the sheared bolt end and nut however, these items have not been found. It is unknown when the damage occurred.  Three things arise from this event. 1. Impact between the crane and VLS deflector 2. Dropped object being the nut and tail of the bolt 3 Near miss from the potential for the bolt remaining in the wire guard hole to drop.  The initial incident in this case is the NOV crane making contact with the VLS gutter deflector causing superficial damage to the deflector. This event is treated as an accident which triggers two consequences as a result on the contact.  1. The first consequence is a dropped object event from the sheared bolt end and nut falling 25m to deck level. The estimated weight of the dropped object is 211g. The weight and height of the dropped object is know from the marks on the VLS deflector and is calculated as minor on the drops calculator. 2. The second consequence is a near miss due to the potential for the remaining section of the bolt that has remained inside the guard to fall out of the guard hole to the deck. The weight of remaining bolt part is 392g and gives a dropped object rating of major.  Review of the risk matrix for the accident event of crane impacting  the VLS deflector plate is rated 1 being a 1 for severity as the damage was limited to a sheared bolt. The accident is given a possible rating for likelihood of 1 as this is the first time the crane has made contact with the VLS in two years.   Review of the risk matrix for the dropped nut and bolt end when reviewing likelihood and severity gives a drops rating of 8. This comprises a 2 for severity based on the drops calculator and a three (possible) as the likelihood.  Review of the risk matrix for the near miss potential of the bolt falling out of the guard hole is 16. This is based on a severity of 3 based on drops calculator and a likelihood of a 3 due to probability of 10-30% chance of occurrence.",Uncontrolled moving objects/ parts (struck by other than machine parts and dropped objects),Construction - Installation-Decommissioning,Safe Mechanical Lifting - Plan lifting operations and control the area,True,True,Deep Orient HSE (deeporient.hse@technipfmc.com),4/29/2024,False,Completed,3.0,,12/23/2024,7/31/2024,TPOCEANIA - Australia - Perth,TFMC505,Deep Orient HSE (deeporient.hse@technipfmc.com),Deep Orient HSE,,ACCIDENTS_translated,,,,,

During the hose change the rope was inadvertently knocked out of the cam lock, due to the fact that the rope was not tied off the dive hat descended approximately 50 to 100 mm on to the divers head, this resulted in no physical injury requiring treatment, just redness on the scalp of the head  Current situation/Initial actions taken: The situation was discussed with the bellman and diver #1 and the response was that there was an area of redness but it was not a problem and that diver #1 was OK to continue and did not require any treatment.  Immediate Actions: Once back in the water the dive supervisor confirmed with diver #1 that they were OK and confirmation was given that all was OK.  Follow on Actions: The weight of the hat was checked and was found to be 14.9KG. The drops calculator was used to asses the potential of the event, under normal circumstances the hat would be held by the pulley system approximately 100mm to 200mm above the divers head whilst on a refreshment break. The absolute maximum height it could be held would be approximately 0.5M above the divers head, however, the COBRA hose lengths on the COBRA units used at the time would limit this significantly. The position of the hat is above the seated area in the bell, the only potential for the hat to drop on to he divers head would be in the seated position directly below the hat, under normal circumstances the hat is at or below shoulder height. Given the 14.9KG and an actual height of .1M the result would be slight however, the drops calculator is calculated with the wearing of ""standard PPE, eg hard hat, safety boots and eye protection, is assumed in the calculator"".  Diver 1 did not have head protection at the time of the event.  If the height was increased to half a meter the result would be for a minor: MINOR: A Medical Treatment Case (MTC).

The construction crew were working on the TLS table above the moonpool installing bend stiffeners to the Riser 5 top dynamic section. During this period at approx.. 22:15 the smell of hydraulic oil was noticed by a crew member in the location and on looking down into the moonpool a small sheen of oil was observed in the water below.  The TLS team were immediately notified and started to look for a potential source of the oil sheen.  As operations were continuing with product through the moonpool the TLS team were unable to gain access to observe the table hydraulic system. When Riser Top 5 Dynamic section was connected to the A&R wire (with the hang off frame removed) the moon pool doors were opened to allow the team access to inspect the system.  In the background the management and supervisors had planned the inspection and prepared the necessary documentation to get a PTW issued for the task.  On inspection by the TLS team, they found a minor leak / seepage at the portside cylinder aft of no.6 ram of the moonpool table. Approx. 20 litres of hydraulic oil (Mobil Univi-46, SDS attached) was discharged from the hydraulic ram. It is estimated that less than a litre was observed actually in the seawater domain in the moonpool. The remaining oil was caught within the moonpool door structure.

At 0330hrs the Huisman was connected with a 12Te Buoyance Module (BM) in preparation to deploy the ILT through the splash zone. The OCS commenced the pay-out on PR2 ILT with crane connected to the 12te BM, in Constant tension, conducting the deployment as per the project lay tables/lift plan. During the process, the static buoy and ILT were submerged, with the dynamic buoy still supported by crane. The crane was approx. 2-3m clear of splash zone. At this point the Pipelay system stopped due to failure of the Aft Reel Motor #1 Bridge rectifier. The vessel was brought to a stop. With the crane still connected, the load on the crane fluctuated as Constant tension struggled to maintain pace with the pitch and heave of the vessel with the maximum load quickly creeping up to the SWL of the crane. During this period, the SOCS and Crane op made the decision to knuckle in on the crane and reduce the radius by 2m, thus giving new SWL 52te with minor change in fleet angle.

At 10:33 am, it was noted that the hydraulic unit of the ROV was stopped. Both engines (port and starboard) stopped and the vehicle landed on the seabed without causing damage to itself or nearby assets. The ROV was recovered in a controlled manner to the cage (TMS) and then, at 12:00 pm, recovered to the vessel. It was noted the loss of 0.5L of Shell Tellus 32 hydraulic fluid, released to the sea. The protection device acted, causing the immediate shutdown of the HPU as expected, preventing the release of a greater amount of hydraulic fluid. The subcontractor's technical team initiated the first actions and reported a sheared bolt on the flange of the hydraulic starboard pump, which caused the flange seal (o-ring) to be ""ejected"", causing the leak.  Initial actions taken: - TechnipFMC and Client representatives on board the vessel have been notified. - Replacement of the pump and torqueing of the 4 screws and o-ring of the connection of the new port and starboard pumps. - Investigation started by Oceaneering..  Notes: - Shell Tellus 32 hydraulic fluid (classified as 97% hydraulic oil with 3% additives) – SDS/MSDS attached (no danger information, according to GHS, and as it is not a dangerous product it does not have a UN number).

Ambos os motores (bombordo e boreste) pararam e o veículo pousou no leito marinho sem causar danos à si ou ativos próximos. O ROV foi recuperado de maneira controlada para a gaiola (TMS) e, às 12:00h pm, recuperado à embarca??o. Foi notada a perda de 0,5L de fluido hidráulico Shell Tellus 32, liberado ao mar. O dispositivo de prote??o atuou, causando o desligamento imediato da HPU conforme previsto, evitando libera??o de maior quantidade de fluido hidráulico. A equipe técnica do subcontratado iniciou as primeiras a??es e reportou um parafuso cisalhado no flange da bomba hidráulica de boreste, o que fez com que a veda??o do flange (o-ring) fosse “ejetada”, causando o vazamento.  A??es imediatas: - Representantes da TechnipFMC e Cliente a bordo da embarca??o foram notificados. - Substitui??o da bomba e torqueamento dos 4 parafusos e o-ring da conex?o da nova bomba de boreste. - Investiga??o iniciada pela Oceaneering.

This allowed no venting to the atmosphere.  This is normally left open to atmosphere to allow any risidual pressure to bleed off when pressure is dumped at the completion of the pressure test.  At the completion of the pressure test, all pressure was vented and the employee was allowed access to the test cell.  The employee attempted to remove the quick connect fiting, installed previously, but was unsuccesful.  The quick connect was unable to be removed which indicated pressure.  The employee exited the test cell and secured it.  After securing the test cell the employee notified local management.  The test cell remained secured until further action could be decided upon.
