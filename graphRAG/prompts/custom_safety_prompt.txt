Goal
----
Produce a clean, auditable safety knowledge graph with normalized entities,
short descriptions, and canonical relation types.

Quality Bar
-----------
1. Use evidence-only extraction. If the text does not explicitly support a node
   or edge, omit it instead of guessing.
2. Entity surface form: uppercase, <= 4 words, no stop-words (THE, A, OF).
3. Always leverage the structured sections supplied in the input
   (`INCIDENT_LABEL`, `INCIDENT_ID`, `NARRATIVE`, `ENTITY_FACTS`, `META_FACTS`).
4. `INCIDENT_LABEL` is the canonical name for the incident node. Use it exactly
   as given (e.g., `NEAR MISS 29857 - DROPPED PRY BAR`) when creating
   `INCIDENT_TYPE` entities.
5. Draw candidates for equipment, injuries, body parts, organizations, locations,
   and dates from `ENTITY_FACTS`. Treat `META_FACTS` as context only.
6. Skip generic placeholders like "INCIDENT", "WORKPLACE", "EMPLOYEE", "CASE".
7. Prefer domain nouns over adjectives (e.g., "FORKLIFT" not "HEAVY").
8. The input escapes real line breaks as literal `\n`. Interpret `\n` as a newline
   while reading, but never emit `\n` as an entity or relation.

Entity Construction
-------------------
- entity_name: uppercase alias, <= 4 words, normalized via the table below.
- entity_type: one of {entity_types}.
- entity_description: 5-12 words describing the role or attributes. Mention
  severity, laterality (left/right), or function if it reduces ambiguity.
- For incident nodes, reuse the provided `INCIDENT_LABEL`.
- Enforce normalization (examples):
  * stairs, stairway, staircase -> STAIRS
  * forklift, lift truck, 20T forklift -> FORKLIFT
  * crane, overhead crane -> CRANE
  * left/right hands, fingers -> HAND / FINGER (side in description)
  * burns, scald -> BURN
- DATE entities must reuse ISO-like text strings from `ENTITY_FACTS` (no reformatting).

Relation Construction
---------------------
Allowed relation types only:
- CAUSED_BY: `INCIDENT_TYPE` or `INJURY_TYPE` caused by `EQUIPMENT`, `TASK`, or
  another `INCIDENT_TYPE`.
- RESULTED_IN: `INCIDENT_TYPE` leading to an `INJURY_TYPE`.
- INVOLVED: `INCIDENT_TYPE` referencing equipment, organization, or supporting
  teams directly engaged in the event.
- OCCURRED_AT: `INCIDENT_TYPE` anchored to `LOCATION` or `DATE`.
- AFFECTED: `INJURY_TYPE` -> `BODY_PART`.
- USED_IN: `INCIDENT_TYPE` or `TASK` -> `EQUIPMENT` that was intentionally used.

Strength scoring: 10 = explicit cause/effect, 8 = strong textual evidence,
5 = contextual co-location only.

Formatting
----------
Entity tuple:
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

Relationship tuple:
("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source>{tuple_delimiter}<target>{tuple_delimiter}<relation_type>{tuple_delimiter}<strength>)

Separate tuples with {record_delimiter} and end the entire response with {completion_delimiter}.

Example
-------
Text:
INCIDENT_LABEL: ACCIDENT 324 - 20Ton Forklift dented parking delivery truck
INCIDENT_ID: 324
NARRATIVE:
20T Forklift reversed and dented a parked DHL truck.

ENTITY_FACTS:
- INCIDENT_TYPE: Accident
- WORKPLACE: Nusajaya Campus 2, Iskandar Puteri, Malaysia
- CLIENT: TECHNIPFMC PLC
- REPORTED_DATE: 2022-01-11

META_FACTS:
- META[RISK_COLOR]: Green
- META[STATUS]: Completed
